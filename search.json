    "text": "A central unresolved problem in ecology is to understand how ecological structure is assembled, mantained, and reorganized as biodiversity changes. Ecological structure does not arise from presence/absence of species alone, but from the interaction of processes including trait evolution, environmental filtering, demographic dynamics, and species interactions. These processes operating across ecological and evolutionary scales, jointly determine which organisms co-occur, how they interact, and how communities are organized in space and time.\nIn this work, I reframe biodiversity change as the outcome of layered assembly processes that structure ecological organization across scales, and I examine this framework using large-scale data on interaction networks, species traits, climatic reconstructions, and fossil occurrence records to (i) develop a trait-based framework to examine how bottom-up and top-down assembly structure ecological networks along environmental gradients. (ii) evaluate how climate-driven mismatches in functional richness between trophic levels generate functional trophic asymmetry and influence network structure of regional palm-mammal frugivore neotropical networks. (iii) assess how deep time climate dynamics structured the similarity of continental large-mammal faunas in North America and Europe.\nCollectively, findings in this thesis demonstrate that changes in ecological structure arise from layered assembly processes operating across spatial and temporal scales. At the local level, structure is expressed through ecological interactions shaped by species traits. These traits are not freely assembled but are constrained by regional climatic filters and the evolutionary history of the species pool. More broadly, this work shows how digitally available biodiversity data can be synthesized using open-source tools and techniques to reveal underlying principles of ecological organization at planetary scales, linking local interactions, regional trait distributions, and evolutionary history within unified process-based frameworks.",

    "text": "Understanding how ecosystems respond to biodiversity change is a central challenge in ecology (Loreau et al. 2001; Hooper et al. 2012). Species colonize new areas, go extinct, and shift their abundances in response to climate change, land-use change, and interactions with humans (Sala et al. 2000; Tylianakis et al. 2008; Newbold et al. 2015). These changes are often visible and easy to document. However, observable changes in species composition are only the surface expression of biodiversity change (Hillebrand et al. 2018; Blowes et al. 2019). The deeper ecological question is how biodiversity change reorganizes the ecological structure of natural ecosystems.\nEcological structure can be understood as emergent patterns of trait distributions, species interactions, and spatial organization in co-occurring organisms (McGill et al. 2006; Levine et al. 2017; Maynard et al. 2018). These forms of functional organization arise at the community level and cannot be reduced to the sum of individual species characteristics (Tilman et al. 1997; Loreau 2010). The traits species possess, the interactions they form, and the way those interactions are arranged into ecological networks can change even when local species richness remains stable (Hillebrand et al. 2018; Dornelas et al. 2019; Galiana et al. 2019).\nA deeper understanding of biodiversity change therefore requires tracing the processes that generate ecological structure, rather than treating structure as a fixed property of biodiversity (Vellend 2010; HilleRisLambers et al. 2012). Biodiversity change is most often documented through metrics such as species richness, compositional turnover, and taxonomic dissimilarity (Magurran 2004; Baselga 2010). While these measures effectively quantify differences among communities, they provide limited insight into the processes that generate and constrain ecological structure (Chase & Myers 2011; Cadotte & Tucker 2017). Ecological structure is not directly coupled to species composition: it can be conserved under substantial turnover or rapidly reorganized following relatively small compositional changes (Hillebrand et al. 2018; Maynard et al. 2018). To advance the field, it is therefore necessary to move beyond descriptive metrics toward process-based perspectives that focus on how ecological structure is generated and constrained.\nThe search for a process-based framework to understand structural changes in biodiversity naturally leads to the concept of assembly as an organizing principle (Diamond 1975; Weiher & Keddy 1995; Vellend 2010). Rather than cataloguing species lists, assembly processes describe how species pools and interactions are filtered and combined to produce assemblages with ecological structure (Keddy 1992; Gravel et al. 2011). In this work, I recognize a set of layered processes responsible for organizing biodiversity through space and time: evolutionary processes determine which traits exist (Ricklefs 1987; Losos 2011); regional climatic and biogeographic filters determine which traits and species are available locally (Wiens & Donoghue 2004; Svenning et al. 2015); local community assembly determines which species co-occur (Chase & Leibold 2003; HilleRisLambers et al. 2012); and interaction assembly determines who interacts with whom (Vázquez et al. 2009; Bartomeus et al. 2016; Ponisio et al. 2019). This layered view emphasizes which combinations of traits, species, and interactions are possible, and which forms of ecological structure are likely to emerge under given environmental conditions (Lessard et al. 2016; Maynard et al. 2018).\nBy framing biodiversity change in terms of layered assembly processes, ecology gains a unifying framework that links ecological and evolutionary dynamics (Vellend 2016; Pontarp et al. 2019). Assembly provides a way to connect species turnover to structural change, and to understand how ecological organization is assembled, maintained, and reorganized through space and time. This thesis develops and applies this framework across complementary levels of organization and timescales.\n\nIn Chapter 1, I formalize a trait-based framework for ecological network assembly, focusing on how traits, species pools, and interaction rules jointly shape emergent network structure (Vázquez et al. 2009; Bartomeus et al. 2016; Maynard et al. 2018). Using simulations and null models, this chapter separates the roles of community assembly within trophic levels from the assembly of interactions between trophic levels, providing a methodological foundation for inferring local assembly processes from empirical ecological network observations. Specifically, this chapter asks: (1) whether spatial variation in the relative contributions of community assembly and interaction assembly leads to systematic differences in network structure, and (2) how the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down assembly processes changes along environmental gradients and shapes network organization.\nIn Chapter 2, I expand the trait-based network assembly framework to the regional scale by introducing the concept of functional trophic asymmetry to quantify mismatches between producer and consumer functional trait diversity (Dehling et al. 2014; Schleuning et al. 2016; Marjakangas et al. 2022). By combining trait data, interaction data, and machine-learning-based network reconstruction, this chapter addresses five questions concerning climatic drivers of functional richness, the emergence of functional trophic asymmetry, its geographic distribution across the Neotropics, its modulation by interaction strength, and its relationship with network specialization.\nIn Chapter 3, I extend the assembly perspective into deep time, using fossil mammal assemblages and paleoclimatic reconstructions to investigate how long-term climate dynamics drive compositional turnover and structural reorganization (Blois et al. 2013; Finnegan et al. 2015; Lyons et al. 2016). This chapter disentangles the relative roles of directional climate change and climatic instability in shaping biodiversity across geological epochs, evaluating whether different combinations of climatic change magnitude and instability lead to distinct turnover dynamics.\n\nTogether, these chapters show how a layered assembly perspective can be used to link species turnover, trait distributions, interaction networks, and environmental change across scales. By moving from description to process, this work demonstrates how ecological structure emerges from interacting assembly mechanisms, and why understanding these mechanisms is essential for predicting the future reorganization of biodiversity under global change (Tylianakis et al. 2008; Vellend et al. 2017).",

    "text": "Introduction\nThe current focus of community ecology on describing variation in the structure of ecological networks comes at the expense of understanding the processes that underlie such patterns. However, discerning these underlying “rules” is essential for a deeper understanding of biodiversity maintenance in multitrophic communities and for the ability to predict how multitrophic communities might respond to ongoing global change (Ruiter and Moore 2005). While current frameworks rely on functional traits to predict the responses of species to global change and the outcome of pairwise interactions within single trophic levels (Beaudrot and Ahumada 2019), trait-mediated assembly of multitrophic communities remains poorly explored (Seibold et al. 2018). An integrative framework using trait-based inference of assembly processes could further both our fundamental understanding of multitrophic community assembly and our ability to predict community reassembly amid global change.\nEcologists use trait-based approaches to infer assembly processes that influence the composition of ecological communities (Ackerly and Cornwell 2007; Kraft and Ackerly 2010; Chase and Myers 2011; Cadotte and Tucker 2017). Trait-based inference of assembly processes is possible because species’ traits and niches are two sides of the same coin (Diamond 1975; MacArthur and Levins 1967). On the one hand, trait-based approaches are commonly used to infer assembly processes within trophic levels (Chase and Myers 2011; Chagnon and Klironomos 2015). On the other hand, trait-based approaches are used to define linkage rules that govern the occurrence of pairwise interactions between species at different trophic levels (e.g., Vázquez et al. 2007; Chagnon et al. 2015; Morales-Castilla et al. 2015; Bartomeus et al. 2016; Chacoff et al. 2018; Sonne et al. 2020). Ponisio et al. (2019) laid down the first building blocks for a trait-based framework of network assembly but did not explicitly consider the role of processes influencing the formation of pairwise interactions between trophic levels. A major shortcoming of trait-based community ecology is the lack of integration of within- and between-trophic level inference of assembly processes (Seibold et al. 2018, Ponisio et al. 2019).\nDespite the similar processes governing the assembly of species within and of interactions between trophic levels, the synergistic influence of such processes on multitrophic communities and their network structure remains largely unexplored. Previous work has shown the existence of links between assembly of communities and network structure (Maynard et al. 2018, Tylianakis et al. 2018), and between assembly of pairwise interactions and network structure (Sazatornil et al. 2016, Laigle et al. 2018, Sonne et al. 2020). Thus, the ecological processes operating within and between trophic levels are rather well studied. However, their relative influence and interplay are not well understood. As a step towards the integration of assembly processes operating within and between trophic levels, earlier studies have shown that trophic interactions can affect community composition and vice versa (Gravel et al. 2011), and that the interaction of evolutionary and ecological assembly processes, rather than stability-based selection, determine network structure (Maynard et al. 2018, Medeiros et al. 2018, Valverde et al. 2018). Moreover, recent studies have achieved linking central theories in metacommunity ecology and island biogeography to interaction networks, but those studies have not yet fully integrated processes operating synergistically within and between trophic levels in their models of community assembly (Gravel et al. 2011, Pillai et al. 2011, Thompson and Gonzalez 2017, Guzman et al. 2019, Ponisio et al. 2019, Li et al. 2020). Moreover, one possible shortcoming of these studies is the lack of practical tools to infer assembly processes underpinning network assembly from observational data. Such a practical toolbox would be broadly applicable across awide range of interaction types, including host-parasite, predator-prey, and mutualistic networks. Finally, although large-scale variation in patterns of network structure is increasingly well documented (Schleuning et al. 2012, Albouy et al. 2019, Baiser et al. 2019, Braga et al. 2019), the development of a comprehensive conceptual framework and methodological toolbox for network assembly will enable global comparisons and hopefully the discovery of general “rules” underpinning multitrophic community assembly.\nAn emerging question in community ecology is whether the assembly of lower and higher trophic levels equally influence the overall structure of interaction networks (Albrecht et al. 2018, Maynard et al. 2018, Valverde et al. 2018, Donoso et al. 2020). In the context of ecological networks, bottom-up assembly occurs when processes governing the assembly of the lower trophic level (resource community) have a predominant influence on network structure, whereas top-down assembly occurs when processes underpinning the assembly of the higher trophic level (consumer community) have a predominant influence. For example, in plantfrugivore networks, bottom-up assembly can arise from environmental filtering of plant species and the subsequent indirect influence of plants as the fruit resource on the composition of frugivore communities (Herrera 1995, Albrecht et al. 2018). There is, however, conflicting evidence on the relative occurrence of bottom-up and top-down effects (i.e., the modes of network assembly). One the one hand, some studies suggest that bottom-up effects primarily influence the structure of ecological networks (Scherber et al. 2010). On the other hand, some studies suggest that top-down effects may equal or even exceed bottom-up effects (Seibold et al. 2018). While both bottom-up and top-down assembly might simultaneously affect network structure, their relative influence could vary predictably across environmental gradients. Indeed, differences in the mode of network assembly can arise as a result of distinct environmentalfactors independently affecting the assembly of resource and consumer communities (Kissling et al. 2008, Albrecht et al. 2018). While this shows how changes in environmental conditions may reshape multitrophic communities under global change, there is currently no consensus on a standardized approach to quantify the strength of bottom-up and top-down assembly. We therefore build on previous work (Albrecht et al. 2018) to develop and formalize an approach that can be used for different interaction types and along large environmental gradients.\nThe objective of our work is to provide a conceptual framework and a methodological toolbox that extends trait-based inference of assembly processes to multitrophic communities. We use simulations and apply null models to observational data to disentangle the influence of community assembly processes operating within trophic levels, interaction assembly processes operating between trophic levels, and the mode of network assembly on network structure. In particular, we ask: (1) Does spatial variation in the relative strengths of community and interaction assembly processes lead to predictable variation in network structures?; and (2) How does the relative influence of bottom-up and top-down assembly modes on network structure vary along environmental gradients? We suggest that applying this framework across interaction types (e.g., mutualistic and antagonistic) and biomes will not only enable us to uncover generalities in the way that multitrophic communities assemble, but also to understand how assembly processes interact with environmental gradients, both of which will improve predictions of future biodiversity in a changing world.",

    "text": "1.1 A conceptual framework for network assembly\nWe outline a framework to disentangle the influence of the two building blocks that shape network structure: community and interaction assembly processes (Figure 1). We refer to thewithin-trophic level processes determining the identity and relative abundances of locally cooccurring species that are a subset of a larger species pool as ‘community assembly’ and the between-trophic level processes determining interaction probabilities between species pairs as ‘interaction assembly’. Multitrophic communities can be separated into bipartite (i.e., two-level) networks, in which pairwise interactions occur only between species at two different trophic levels, such as between resources and consumers. In resource-consumer networks, community assembly influences community and trait composition at the resource and consumer trophic levels (Gause 1934, MacArthur and Levins 1967, van der Valk 1981, Hubbell 2001). Interaction assembly then determines the interactions between species pairs present in the local resource and consumer communities (Vázquez et al. 2007, Morales-Castilla et al. 2015, Bartomeus et al. 2016, Valdovinos et al. 2018, Peralta et al. 2020). Although most often considered separately (e.g., Kraft et al. 2008; Morales-Castilla et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018), community and interaction assembly processes likely shape networks in synergy.\nCommunity and interaction assembly processes can both range from stochastic to deterministic (Hubbell 2001, Fisher and Mehta 2014, Ponisio et al. 2019, Valdovinos 2019). Stochastic community assembly processes are unpredictable chance events that act independent of species’ niches (Hubbell 2001, Vázquez et al. 2012, 2015, Fort et al. 2016), so that species are ecologically equivalent and the processes that determine their local occurrence are unrelated to trait selection. Stochastic processes underlying community assembly include ecological drift and demographic and environmental stochasticity (Leibold and McPeek 2006, Vellend 2010). In these cases, the probability of a species being present is determined by stochastic extinction and immigration, which are influenced by the relative abundance of species in the regional pool and the local communities. Similarly, stochastic interaction assembly processes are independent oftrait matching, so that pairwise interactions are based on density-dependent encounter probabilities (Vázquez et al. 2007, 2012, 2015, Olito and Fox 2015, Chacoff et al. 2018). We consider stochastic community and interaction assembly processes as a null hypothesis – that is, a baseline from which to quantify the effects of deterministic trait-based processes on the assembly of network structures.\nIn contrast, deterministic assembly processes act upon species’ environmental and interaction niches that are reflected by functional traits (Leibold and McPeek 2006, McGill et al. 2006, Kraft et al. 2008, Vellend 2010, Maruyama et al. 2018, Spasojevic et al. 2018, Ponisio et al. 2019). Deterministic processes can affect the assembly of communities and interactions in similar ways but acting upon different traits. Under deterministic community assembly, the probability that an individual or a species is present in a community depends on fitness advantages that can be mediated by functional traits. When environmental filtering occurs, a species is excluded from the local community if its niche is not compatible with the local conditions (van der Valk 1981, Keddy 1992). When limiting similarity occurs, species are unable to coexist in a community if their niches are too similar, due to competitive exclusion (Gause 1934, MacArthur and Levins 1967). Deterministic community assembly processes act upon species’ response traits, e.g. those traits that represent species’ physiological constraints (Figure 1). For example, hummingbirds and bees are smaller at high elevations owing to their metabolic demands (Graham et al. 2012, Classen et al. 2017). One approach for estimating the degree of determinism in processes underpinning community assembly is to compare the local trait distribution to one generated by a random sampling of the regional species pool (e.g., Kraft & Ackerly 2010).\nLikewise, deterministic interaction assembly processes act upon matching traits, which are those trait pairs that mediate resource-consumer interactions (Dehling et al. 2014; Schleuning et al. 2020; Figure 1). Such matching traits include for example, corolla depth and beak length in plant-hummingbird networks (Maglianesi et al. 2014, Sonne et al. 2020) or carbohydrate and nutrient supply traits in plant-mycorrhizal fungi networks (Kiers et al. 2011, Chagnon et al. 2013, 2015). When morphological matching occurs, an interaction is more likely to take place when there is a high correspondence between the trait values of interaction partners (Sazatornil et al. 2016), leading to high interaction efficiency (e.g., Maglianesi et al. 2014). Alternatively, when forbidden links occur, a species can only interact with partners that do not exceed a maximum trait value relative to its own trait value (Olesen et al. 2010, Morales-Castilla et al. 2015). For example, small-beaked birds typically cannot eat large fruits, but large-beaked birds can eat fruits of all sizes (Galetti et al. 2013). Because functional traits mediate deterministic assembly, and because deterministic processes might differ depending on whether we focus on community or interaction assembly, we refer to ‘trait-based assembly’ throughout in order to characterize the suite of deterministic processes involved in network assembly.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Processes influencing the assembly and structure of ecological networks. Building blocks on the right illustrate the community and interaction assembly processes that affect the structure of a resource-consumer network. The arrows between the components illustrate the interacting effects of the different components on network structure. The network is illustrated in the middle with circles (red: consumer species; blue: resource species) and grey lines (pairwise resource-consumer interactions). The community assembly processes determine which species in the regional species pools will enter the local resource and consumer communities (illustrated with dotted lines). Under deterministic community assembly, the probability of a species entering the local community depends on its response traits. Under stochastic community assembly, the probability of a species entering the local community depends solely on its abundance in the regional pool. Interaction assembly determines which species pairs in the local communities interact with each other. The deterministic interaction assembly depends on the degree of trait matching between partner species. The stochastic interaction assembly depends on encounter probabilities and the relative abundances of species within the local communities. Community and interaction assembly processes jointly shape the emergent structure of the resource-consumer network.\n\n\nTo test whether variation in assembly processes can indeed influence the structure of networks, we first explored whether and how variation in simulated assembly components leads to predictable variation in resource-consumer network structures (Box 1). Specifically, we examined whether variation in community or interaction assembly is more likely to influence network structure. The simulation results reveal that our framework is able to separate community and interaction assembly processes and that both trait-based community and interaction assembly processes can influence network structure.",

    "text": "1.2 Quantifying the imbalance of assembly processes between trophic levels\nIn addition to the effect of within-trophic level community assembly processes on network structure, differences in the strength of assembly processes between two trophic level can also influence network structure. These differences in the strength of processes can arise, for example, as a result of the different and independent effects of environmental gradients on the assembly of resource and consumer communities (Kissling et al. 2008, Albrecht et al. 2018). Different trophic levels may also differ in the scale of environmental factors to which they respond (Guzman et al. 2019). Therefore, we assume that the relative strength of trait-based community assembly processes between trophic levels (hereafter, process strength asymmetry, PSA) can influence the structure of bipartite networks, for example by influencing the availability of interaction partners (Albrecht et al. 2018). We expect process strength asymmetry to be a widespread phenomenon in nature that promotes the diversity of network structures within a multitrophic species pool. Thus, we propose a way to quantify process strength asymmetry and its effects on network structure. More specifically, we define PSA as the logratio of the strength of trait-based processes at the resource and consumer levels (Appendix S1: Equation S2) and we compare the structure of networks assembled under symmetric (PSA = 0) and asymmetric process strengths (PSA ≠ 0).\nGiven that global change influences species in particular functional groups and trophic levels more than others (e.g., Dirzo et al. 2014), we might expect imbalance to emerge in multitrophic communities worldwide. In order to predict how multitrophic communities might respond to environmental change, it is important to know whether and why resource (bottom-up assembly) or consumer (top-down assembly) communities exert a stronger influence on networkstructure (Gripenberg and Roslin 2007). For example, if the current mode of network assembly is bottom-up, then future changes in resource community composition are more likely to have a strong effect on network structure than would changes in consumer community composition. Moreover, the network assembly mode might trigger an ‘assembly cascade’ whereby assembly processes shaping the composition of one trophic level indirectly govern the assembly of another trophic level via the assembly of pairwise interactions. For example, if a hypothetical hostparasite network with specialized pairwise interactions is assembled bottom-up, the assembly processes determining the composition of the host community can be assumed to also determine the composition of the parasite community indirectly via the parasites’ dependency on their interaction partners.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Illustrated workflow for simulation of community and interaction assembly to form resource-consumer networks. In panel A, individuals were sampled from a regional species pool of 5000 individuals belonging to 500 species to form local communities of 500 individuals. We sampled the resource and consumer communities separately. More specifically, in panel B, individuals were sampled from the regional pool based on different trait selectionprobability functions that simulate stochastic and deterministic (here, environmental filtering with varying intensity) community assembly. The probability function for environmentalfiltering was defined by the standard deviation σopt ∈ [0, 1] around a randomly assigned trait optimum. Thus, the probability that an individual was selected from the regional pool depended on its trait value. In panel C, deterministic (trait-based) and stochastic community assembly scenarios led to different compositions of traits in the local communities. In panel D, the assembly of pairwise interactions between resource and consumer species was simulated such that the probability of an interaction either related to the degree of functional trait matching between a pair of individuals (forbidden links and morphological matching) or depended solely on species’ relative abundances (stochastic). In panel E, simulation of different community and interaction assembly process combinations determined local resource-consumer networks that varied in modularity and nestedness.\n\n\nIn addition to environmentally-induced variation, the assembly mode may vary due to interaction type characteristics, such as the degree of reciprocal dependency. That is, networks in which trophic levels strongly and mutually depend on each other, such as mycorrhizal fungiplant networks, could be expected to vary greatly in their assembly mode. On the contrary, networks in which one trophic level disproportionately depends on the other, such as predatorprey networks, could be expected to experience predominantly bottom-up assembly mode as the predators at the higher trophic level cannot persist locally in the absence of their prey at the lower trophic level. Variation in bottom-up and top-down assembly due to interaction type characteristics has not been explored before, but our framework permits testing for such variation in natural networks. Indeed, the network assembly mode can be quantified by contrasting observed patterns of network structure to a null model (for details, see section 4 and Appendix S1: Equation S7). Generally speaking, the effects of resource and consumer communityassembly on network structure are first quantified separately and then compared to conclude which trophic level has the predominant effect on the observed network structure.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Community and interaction assembly processes define the structure of simulated resource-consumer networks. The simulated networks are shown in a two-dimensional network structure space of modularity and nestedness. Convex hulls delineate the range of network structures for each simulated interaction assembly type. The color of the lines, symbols, and bars indicates the interaction assembly type. Each symbol corresponds to the mean network structure metric value of 10 independent network replicates with deterministic resource and consumer community assembly processes. The effect of deterministic community assembly (here, stabilizing environmental filtering) on network structure is illustrated as the deviation of the colored symbol from the cross with the corresponding color. Cross axis lengths indicate the standard deviation in modularity (horizontal cross axis) and nestedness (vertical cross axis) understochastic community assembly at both trophic levels. The further a symbol is from the cross, the stronger the effect of environmental filtering on network structure. The convex hull areas represent the magnitude of the effect that deterministic community assembly processes have on network structure when interaction assembly type is constant. Deterministic community assembly within each interaction assembly type varies in process strength asymmetry between trophic levels (PSA; log-ratio between the strengths of deterministic resource and consumer assembly processes).

    "text": "1.3 Inferring network assembly from observational data\nDisentangling the relative and combined influence of community and interaction assembly on network structure in natural systems requires a new trait-based toolbox. For application to observational data, such a toolbox must 1) match with the available data , 2) be flexible to modifications in network properties, interaction types, species richness, traits, and other relevant components, and 3) provide user-friendly code and examples of questions and data. Building on our conceptual framework, we propose a null model approach that aligns with these requirements and allows inference of the effects of community and interaction assembly, as well as process strength asymmetry and network assembly mode, on ecological networks. The approach expands previous methods for analyzing single and multiple trophic levels (e.g., Kraft et al. 2008; Morales-Castilla et al. 2015) and will enable ecologists to address central questions in community ecology, biogeography, and conservation ecology (Appendix S3: Table S3). It further enables elucidating changes in the contribution of particular assembly processes to the structure of resource-consumer networks along large-scale environmental gradients (Vellend 2010, Chase and Myers 2011).\nThe approach quantifies the degree to which the observed network structure deviates from the expected structure of a set of null networks. The null networks are generated by null models that exclude the assembly processes of interest. Specifically, the approach consists of three steps outlined below in which we (1) quantify the type and strength of trait-based assembly processes, (2) determine their effects on network structure, and (3) jointly interpret the results of(1) and (2) to relate trait-based processes to network assembly. Here, we use stochastic processes as a baseline for quantification of trait-based processes. Although we recognize that community and interaction assembly likely act in synergy, for simplicity of applying our framework for the first time, we consider community and interaction assembly processes independent of each other. Moreover, for simplicity, we focus our discussion on binary networks whose structure disregards the variation in pairwise interaction frequencies. However, we illustrate how our approach can be used for both binary and quantitative network data.\nApplying our null model approach to empirical data requires information on species’ occurrences in the local communities, relevant response and matching traits, and pairwise interactions. We note that even though functional ecology conceptually differentiates between response and matching traits (Suding et al. 2008), the function of particular traits may in fact be challenging to attribute, and the same trait can be relevant for both community and interaction assembly processes (Schleuning et al. 2015). For example, animal body size can perform both as a response and as a matching trait in mutualistic plant-frugivore networks because it relates to both thermoregulation and to the ability to use different types of fruit resources (McCain and King 2014, Lim et al. 2020). An additional challenge in trait -based inference of network assembly is that response and matching traits may be correlated at the organismal level due to developmental constraints, selection operating on multiple traits and/or non-random associations of the underlying genes (Gardner and Latta 2007, Saltz et al. 2017). So far, we know little about the extent of such trait correlations, especially across environmental gradients and for different trophic levels (Peres-Neto et al. 2012, Schleuning et al. 2020).\nAs response and matching traits are entwined, one could argue that all traits can perform as both response and matching traits, but to different degrees and contingent on theenvironmental context. We suggest that trait selection should be based on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the study system, and the specific environmental context (e.g., Schleuning et al. 2020). Theoretical frameworks can provide clear criteria to characterize and prioritize traits within the ecological context of interest (Kearney et al. 2021). An additional possibility is the use of synthetic traits obtained with multivariate (ordination) methods to reduce trait dimensions and account for potential correlations among traits (Albrecht et al. 2018). Moreover, multivariate methods for traits can be combined with information on pairwise interactions to aid the selection of matching traits (Thuiller et al. 2006, Dray et al. 2014, Albrecht et al. 2018). Such approaches may also be a way forward from the often arbitrary categorization of response and matching traits towards more holistic multitrophic approaches in trait-based ecology.\nStep 1. The type and strength of trait-based community and interaction assembly processes\nFirst, the trait distributions of resource and consumer species are compared to those generated from random sampling of the regional pool to detect the type and strength of trait-based community assembly processes, such as environmental filtering or limiting similarity (MacArthur and Levins 1967, Weiher and Keddy 1995, Cadotte and Tucker 2017). The strength of the trait-based community assembly process can be quantified as the standardized effect size of an appropriate metric of trait variation, such as the range or standard deviation of trait values (Kraft and Ackerly 2010, Munoz et al. 2018). Second, the trait-based interaction assembly processes can be detected by testing for the strength of associations in traits between the trophic levels, for instance by using RLQ and fourth corner analyses (e.g., Dehling et al. 2014; Dray et al. 2014; Albrecht et al. 2018). RLQ analysis is an ordination method for quantifyingassociations of two matrices via a third matrix, such as plant and animal traits via their interactions, and fourth-corner analysis uses a permutation approach to test whether these associations differ from a null expectation (Dolédec et al. 1996, Dray et al. 2014). These two analyses allow evaluation of the strength of trait-based processes relative to a stochastic interaction assembly.\nStep 2. The influence of trait-based assembly processes on network structure\nThe influence of trait-based processes on network structure is inferred by comparing observed network metric values, such as modularity and nestedness, to those derived from four sets of null models (Vázquez & Aizen 2003; Dormann et al. 2009; Table 1A). These four process-based null models are then used as heuristic tools to investigate which combination of processes most likely influences network structure (Gotelli et al. 2010, Lessard et al. 2012). Specifically, null model algorithms are used to assemble null networks from a regional pool, such that some assembly components are identical to the observed network, while other assembly components are allowed to vary stochastically. The influence of a given assembly component on observed network structure is then estimated by calculating a standardized effect size (SESNET; as in Equation S7 in Appendix S1). The greater the SESNET, the stronger the effect of the simulated assembly component(s) on network structure. The influence of trait-based effects is then calculated in relation to each null model (Table 1A) and assembly component (Table 1B). That is, by comparing SES NET derived from different null models, we can infer the relative effects of trait based resource, consumer, and interaction assembly on network structure (Table 1B). These assembly component-specific SES NET values can also be used to quantify the network assembly mode. For this, first a standardized effect size of network structure (SESNET) is quantified for each trophic level separately (Table 1A). Then, the assembly mode of the bipartite network is quantified as the log-ratio of the effect sizes (SESNET) between resource and consumer trophic levels (Appendix S1: Equation S7). The generation of null networks as well as the quantification of assembly mode are exemplified both in the simulations (Box 1) and in the case study (the associated codes are available in a repository, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4604951).\nStep 3. Interpretation of results\nTo infer the type and strength of trait-based or stochastic community and interaction processes involved in the assembly of the observed network, we interpret the combined results of Steps 1 and 2. Specifically, the assembly processes identified in Step 1 are inferred to govern the effect of a given assembly component on network structure detected in Step 2. For example, suppose we observe that environmental filtering shapes the consumer trophic level (Step 1) and traitbased consumer assembly has the strongest effect on network modularity in comparison to the other assembly components (Step 2). From this, we can infer that environmental filtering of the consumers has the strongest influence on the modularity of the network (see Table 1 for a full account of how to interpret the null model results).",

    "text": "1.4 Case study: Mutualistic network assembly along an elevational gradient\nTo illustrate the applicability of our framework, we explored the influence of community assembly processes, including process strength asymmetry, on the structure of observational plant-frugivore networks along an elevational gradient in the Andes in Ecuador (Quitián et al.2018, 2019; Figure 4). Specifically, we asked whether (1) the asymmetry of assembly process strengths (PSA) between plant and frugivore communities and (2) the influence of PSA on network structure varied along the elevational gradient. Answering these questions enables us to assess variation in the predominance of bottom-up and top-down effects on network assembly along the elevational gradient.\nTo explore these questions, we assumed that the same traits act as both response and matching traits for plants and frugivorous birds. Specifically, we assumed that environmental filtering and trait matching are mediated by the same traits as they are associated with both energy use and foraging (Appendix S3: Figure S 2). This assumption is justifiable at least for plant-frugivore interactions (Donoso et al. 2020, Peña et al. 2020). To determine how a given set of species’ functional traits correlates with environmental properties and interaction type characteristics (i.e., which traits are most representative response and matching traits), information on the trait-environment and trait-interaction relationships for a particular taxon must be available. If no such information is available, RLQ and fourth corner analyses can be used to explore and test trait-environment and trait-interaction relationships (Dolédec et al. 1996, Dray et al. 2014, Albrecht et al. 2018). In our case study, we used fruit length, width and mass, and plant height as response and matching traits for plants, and bill length and width, body mass, and hand-wing index as response and matching traits for birds, based on evidence from previous work (Dehling et al. 2016, Bender et al. 2018).\nWe used RLQ analysis to map the plant and animal species into a common multivariate functional trait space based on the selected traits and an aggregated metanetwork of pairwise interactions across the elevational gradient (Dehling et al. 2014, Dray et al. 2014, Albrecht et al. 2018). This was done via a simultaneous ordination of the three matrices that describe the plantand animal traits and the pairwise interactions. To quantify the strength of interaction assembly processes, we used the strength of the plant-frugivore trait associations obtained with the RLQ and applied a fourth corner permutation test (model 4) to test whether the trait associations are different from what would be expected if species interacted randomly (ter Braak et al. 2012).\nThen, we used the species scores of plants and animals on the first RLQ axis of the multivariate trait space to test for multitrophic trait-environment relationships (Figure 4A-B). We used these synthetic trait axes because they are comparable between trophic levels and thus allow an assessment of differences in the relative magnitude of deterministic community assembly processes between plants and animals. To quantify the strength of community assembly processes at both trophic levels, we quantified the standardized effect size of trait distribution in both plant and frugivore communities. The standardized effect size was obtained by comparing the standard deviation of the synthetic trait distributions relative to those expected from a resampling of the species pool (i.e., null communities). The delineation of species pools can strongly influence the inference of community assembly processes (Lessard et al. 2012, 2016). Here, we defined site-specific regional species pools using a probabilistic process-based approach that accounts for environmental dissimilarities and geographic distances among sites (Graves and Gotelli 1983, Zobel 1997, Lessard et al. 2016) (Appendix S3: section S2). Thus, we gave equal weight to dispersal probability and establishment probability in our definition of species pools (Lessard et al. 2016). We estimated dispersal probabilities among sites by calculating least-cost path distances between sites penalized by geographic distance, topography, elevation, temperature, and precipitation (Hijmans et al. 2005, Farr et al. 2007). We estimated establishment probabilities for each site by calculating environmental similarity between the focal site and the other sites included in the species pool. We used Euclidean distances amongsites in a multivariate environmental space obtained with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate environmental similarity among sites.\nWe also assessed the variation in process strength asymmetry along the elevational gradient by quantifying the log-ratio of the strengths of plant and frugivore community assembly processes. Specifically, we took the natural logarithm of the ratio of frugivore and plant community assembly strengths that were quantified as standardized effect sizes in the previous step (Appendix S1: Equation S2). A positive log-ratio indicated a relatively stronger deterministic process at the frugivore level, whereas negative log-ratio indicated a relatively stronger deterministic process at the plant level. In addition, we calculated the mode of assembly for all networks along the gradient. The assembly mode is obtained with the null model approach (section 4) and it quantifies the relative effect of trait filtering on network structure between two trophic levels (section 3). The assembly mode can be bottom-up or top-down, here contingent on whether the deterministic assembly of plant or frugivore community has the larger effect on network structure.\nWe quantified the network-level structure of the plant-frugivore networks with metrics of modularity and nestedness (for details, see Appendix S1: section S4). Highly modular networks are characterized by cohesive sub-clusters of species interacting more with each other than with other species present in the network (Olesen et al. 2007). In perfectly nested networks, interaction partners of specialists are subsets of the interaction partners of generalists (Bascompte et al. 2003). We quantified modularity and nestedness with the Z-scores of Barber’s Q and Almeida-Neto’s NODF metrics, respectively (Barber 2007, Almeida-Neto et al. 2008). We repeated the analyses using weighted networks based on interaction frequencies and obtainedqualitatively consistent results (Appendix S3: Table S 1, Figure S 4). For more details on the case study methods, see Appendix S3.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Sampling design and structure of plant-frugivore networks along an elevational gradient in the Andes of Ecuador. Panel A illustrates the observed changes in plant-frugivore networks in six distinct sites distributed along three distinct elevation bands, ranging from 1000 to 3000 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l). The inner colored nodes represent the observed plant (blue) and frugivore (red) species and the grey lines represent pairwise interactions between plants and frugivores. The outer colored nodes represent the plant and frugivore species’ trait scores along a synthetic trait axis. The synthetic trait axis corresponds to the first axis of the RLQ analysis that scale and rotate the multidimensional trait variation of both trophic levels based on a matrix of interspecific interactions. Panel C illustrates the probabilities of pairwise interactions between plant and frugivore species in each of the six networks. Interaction probabilities are obtained from a two-dimensional kernel density estimation of the trait scores of plants and frugivores along the first axis of RLQ analysis. The color gradient indicates the probability of an interaction between species pairs with matching traits at each elevation. For details on the case study methods, see Appendix S3.\n\n\nDoes process strength asymmetry vary along the elevational gradient?\nProcess strength asymmetry peaked at mid elevation but did not vary systematically along the elevational gradient (Figure 5A-B). Generally, plant communities tended to be under stronger filtering than frugivore communities along the elevational gradient. The largest process strength asymmetry recorded at mid-elevation was driven by a strong overdispersion in the functional diversity of frugivore communities. This peak in asymmetry at mid-elevation was likely due to the fact that variation in climate along the elevational gradient has independent and distinct effects on plant and frugivore communities (Albrecht et al. 2018).\nIn support of this hypothesis, the strength of community assembly processes peaked at different elevations for the different trophic levels. For plants, the strength of environmental filtering peaked at mid elevation but was also significant at low elevation. For frugivores, the strength of environmental filtering was rather weak at mid -elevation and peaked at low elevation. One possible explanation for such differences in the strength of filtering between trophic levels is that environmental conditions at mid-elevation harbor characteristics of both low and high elevation environments and therefore support species and functional traits typical of both environments. Such ‘biome mixing’ may drive trait overdispersion and a high functional diversity at mid-elevation (Swenson et al. 2012, Lamanna et al. 2014), which may then lead to process strength asymmetry.\nDoes the influence of process strength asymmetry on network structure vary along the elevational gradient?\nThe structure of plant-frugivore networks varied along the elevational gradient (Figure 5C). However, the change in network structure did not correspond with a change in process strength asymmetry (Figure 5B). All plant-frugivore networks sampled along the elevational gradient were significantly more modular and less nested than the networks generated by the null model. Although process strength asymmetry was idiosyncratic along the elevational gradient, such asymmetry was generally driven by stronger filtering of plants. Moreover, the assembly mode was generally bottom-up (Figure 5D). In this case, bottom-up assembly mode means that the filtering of plant traits had a larger effect on network structure than the filtering of frugivore traits. This result is also consistent with the filtering of plant traits and the overdispersion of frugivore traits along the elevational gradient. Such imbalance in the effects of community assembly on network structure may arise from a stronger regionalization of plant communities and better dispersal capabilities of avian frugivores along the gradient.\nTo further understand the factors influencing network structure along elevational gradients, a next step would be to explore the influence of ecological, evolutionary, and historical processes on network assembly mode. The influence of historical and evolutionary processes on network assembly mode could be studied using an established comparative phylogenetic framework (Lagomarsino et al. 2016) that allows linking the observed assembly mode to historical processes across biogeographical scales. For example, the observation that plant-frugivore networks were mainly assembled bottom-up across the elevational gradient could reflect the interaction of multiple processes, such as mountain uplift and historical climate change, differentially influencing ecological trait selection and/or trait diversification betweentrophic levels (Lagomarsino et al. 2016, Luzuriaga-Aveiga and Weir 2019, Valenta and Nevo 2020). Understanding the sources of variation behind process strength asymmetry and network assembly mode may reveal novel network-environment relationships and help to separate similarly structured networks by their assembly processes. Thus, quantifying trophic level imbalances in network assembly is highly relevant for predicting the future of biodiversity in the context of global change.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Trait-based community assembly processes shape the structure of six plant frugivore networks along an elevational gradient in the Andes of Ecuador. Panel A illustrates the strength of trait-based community assembly processes (i.e., environmental filtering) for plants (blue) and frugivores (red) for six networks at three elevational bands. Panel B illustrates the process strength asymmetry (PSA) along the elevational gradient. PSA indicates which trophic level experiences a stronger deterministic community assembly process (here, trait filtering or overdispersion). We quantified PSA as the log-ratio of the observed strengths of community assembly processes between the plants and frugivores. If the red line is longer than the adjacent blue line, the process strength asymmetry is frugivore-driven (PSA &gt; 0). Conversely, if the blue line is longer than the adjacent red line, the process strength asymmetry is plant-driven (PSA &lt; 0). Panel C illustrates the variation in modularity (Q Z-scores) and nestedness (NODF Z-scores) along the elevational gradient. Panel D shows the variation in network assembly mode along the elevational gradient. Network assembly mode is quantified as the log-ratio between the absolute effect magnitudes of deterministic plant and frugivore assembly processes on network structure. In bottom-up and top-down assembly modes, plant and frugivore community assembly effects are predominant, respectively. If the relative magnitudes of bottom-up and top-down assembly modes are equivalent, the network assembly mode = 0. For details on the case study methods, see Appendix S3.\n\n\nINSIGHTS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS\nAddressing ‘big questions’ in community ecology\nWith the aim of uncovering generalities of multitrophic network assembly, our framework can be applied together with trait and interaction data to answer a wide range of ‘big questions’ in community ecology (Appendix S3: Table S3). For example, how does the type and relative influence of assembly processes in multitrophic networks vary across space and time? Understanding network assembly at large spatiotemporal scales is important because global change drivers profoundly affect the composition of communities and ecological network, thereby affecting ecosystem functions and services (Tylianakis et al. 2008, Montoya and Raffaelli 2010, Tabi et al. 2020).\nIn nature, complex multitrophic communities involve more than two trophic levels and more than one interaction type. For instance, plant-frugivore networks are embedded within multitrophic networks that involve pollination, seed dispersal, and predation. Studying networks of different interaction types and of varying numbers of trophic levels can reveal how complex multitrophic communities are disassembled and reassembled through time in response to global change. From an applied research perspective, when estimating the impacts of global change one cosystem functioning and stability, changes in metrics of network structure, such as modularity and nestedness, are often linked to resilience (May 1972, Thébault and Fontaine 2010, Jiang et al. 2018). Identifying the assembly processes that yield more stable multitrophic networks could thus provide essential information for global change mitigation and conservation prioritization (Allesina and Tang 2012, Rohr et al. 2014, Levine et al. 2017).\nLeveraging global trait and interaction data to answer ‘big questions’ in community ecology\nA global deficit of data describing species’ traits and interactions (i.e., Raunkiæran and Eltonian shortfalls; Hortal et al. 2015) has hampered progress in ecology. In particular, data availability in biodiverse tropical regions is scarce compared to temperate regions (Boakes et al. 2010, Meyer et al. 2015). Recent data mobilization efforts (e.g., BioTime, Mangal; Dornelas et al. 2018, Vissault et al. 2019) have nevertheless begun to fill some of these gaps. For example, comprehensive and high-quality data of trophic interactions, functional traits, and species’ occurrences have recently become available, even in the tropics, for some well-studied taxa, such as birds (e.g., Bello et al. 2017; Hasui et al. 2018; Pigot et al. 2020). Globally, large databases of plant and animal traits have been published (e.g., Kattge et al. 2011; Wilman et al. 2014; Myhrvold et al. 2015; Faurby et al. 2018) or are being developed, and they offer unprecedented opportunities to address and reassess ‘big questions’ in community and network ecology at continental or global scales (Appendix S3: Table S3). To facilitate answering the big questions, the accumulation of high - quality trait data will also allow to improve the selection and identification of response and matching traits for different taxa and interaction types. Various ecological and evolutionary processes can generate intraspecific variation in traits (Moran et al. 2016). Such intraspecific traitvariation can mask assembly processes if the processes are inferred using only species-level trait data (Violle et al. 2012). To further advance process-based inference of assembly processes, we encourage collection of individual-level data of both response and matching traits. As a next step, individual- and population-level trait data as well as species-specific trait-environment relationships could be recorded and incorporated into our framework to detect fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in network assembly processes. With this framework, we develop the necessary concepts to take full advantage of these new data sources and narrow the gap between pattern- and process-oriented approaches in macroecology and community ecology.\nLimitations and future directions\nAdmittedly, our framework is only a first step towards improving inference of multitrophic community assembly. Several measures can be implemented to extend our framework. Firstly, future null model approaches of network assembly could incorporate more explicit trait matching processes and the effect of varying interaction assembly (i.e., trait matching) on the composition of local communities. For this, linkage rule functions can be modelled at the site level based on traits and phylogenetic similarities (e.g. Bartomeus et al. 2016; Benadi et al. 2021). Secondly, we generally assume equal importance of assembly processes across species, even though the level of determinism of species occurrences or pairwise interactions might depend on species’ traits or environmental factors (Peralta et al. 2020, Sonne et al. 2020). However, the structure of our framework is flexible and allows future exploration of variation in species-specific responses to deterministic and stochastic assembly processes. For example, in our simulations, the probability that a species will be selected from a species pool into a local community can be species- or sites pecific. Moreover, the degree of intraspecific trait variation could be set to differ among species according to empirical evidence of phylogenetic or ecological constraints in trait plasticity. As a next step, an R package of the null model approach with possible extensions to the aforementioned components will be developed to allow easy application of the toolbox to empirical data.\nTo extend our framework, further work is needed to develop approaches enabling the study of quantitative networks. Here, we mainly focus on the presence-absence of pairwise interactions and ignore effects of varying interaction strength or frequency among species pairs (Vázquez et al. 2007). Our framework can accommodate quantitative interaction data that are based on species’ relative abundances or interaction frequencies, but we note that interpreting interaction frequencies as a proxy of relative abundances and using them to infer assembly processes should be done with caution, particularly when the networks are assembled under strong trait-based processes. Future research can apply our framework to quantitative data by either developing additional methods for incorporating the uncertainty that originates from using interaction frequencies or, preferably, increasing the collection of abundance data in general. To complement the use of quantitative data, species-level metrics (e.g., centrality; Martín González et al. 2010) and weighted networks can be used to quantify network structure. In that regard, our framework is already applicable to weighted networks by using weighted metrics, such as weighted modularity (Beckett 2016), weighted nestedness (Almeida-Neto and Ulrich 2011), metrics borrowed from spectral graph theory (e.g., graph energy; Chung 1996), or other widely used quantitative measures of network complexity (Bonchev and Buck 2005).\nWe note that there are challenges in inferring assembly processes from local trait distributions. Density-regulated, competition-driven communities may exhibit trait patterns similar to communities under environmental filtering (Chesson 2000, Mayfield and Levine2010). Therefore, it is not possible to fully separate the effects of different assembly processes using patterns of trait convergence and divergence alone (HilleRisLambers et al. 2012, Cadotte and Tucker 2017). Future work may use one of several solutions proposed by other authors to support the inference of network assembly processes, such as selecting traits that correlate with environmental conditions (e.g., Cadotte and Tucker 2017), incorporating experimental data (Kraft et al. 2015) or demographic models (HilleRisLambers et al. 2012), defining ecologicallyexplicit species pools (Lessard et al. 2012), and testing hypotheses that involve multiple dimensions of functional niche occupancy (Li et al. 2018). Similar limitations can also apply to the inference of trait-based processes in interaction networks (Dormann et al. 2017) and require additional conceptual and methodological developments.",

    "text": "1.5 Conclusions\nThe current focus of network ecology is largely on describing patterns of network structure (e.g., Fortuna et al. 2010, Schleuning et al. 2012, Trøjelsgaard and Olesen 2013) and their consequences for network dynamics and stability (Allesina and Pascual 2008, Thébault and Fontaine 2010, Allesina and Tang 2012, Grilli et al. 2016). While our knowledge of how network structure varies in space and time has greatly improved (e.g., Galiana et al. 2019, Schwarz et al. 2020), the processes involved in generating such patterns remain obscure (Maynard et al. 2018). Moving network ecology beyond a descriptive endeavor and into a hypothesis-driven science requires new ways of thinking about community and interaction assembly. Our framework shows the necessity of considering community and interaction assembly simultaneously in network ecology. Indeed, it is now possible to ask when and where, not whether, community assembly matters more than interaction assembly in determining network structure. This is a crucial step towards predicting network structure in space and time and forms an essential basis for predicting range shifts of interacting species and community assembly in a changing world (Gounand et al. 2016, Schleuning et al. 2020, Blanchet et al. 2020). As such, our framework is a powerful tool to uncover mechanisms that take place at the interface of community and interaction assembly, while improving predictions of biodiversity in space and time.\n\n\n\n\nAckerly, D.

    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nEcologists often examine patterns of functional trait diversity to investigate community assembly processes (Ackerly 2003; Kraft et al. 2015). To date, however, trait-based approaches in ecology often focus on a single trophic level, whereas approaches that consider multiple trophic levels remain rare (Lavorel et al. 2013; Seibold et al. 2018). An approach that considers processes operating within and between trophic levels is necessary to better understand the assembly of multitrophic communities (Allesina, Alonso, and Pascual 2008; Marjakangas et al. 2022; Saravia et al. 2022). Moreover, considering trophic interactions while studying community assembly could shed new light on processes underpinning ecological networks (Allesina, Alonso, and Pascual 2008)\nClassical approaches to study community assembly rely on the concept of environmental filtering, sorting or selection, where density independent conditions constrain the functional richness of species assemblages (Laliberté and Legendre 2010; Villéger, Mason, and Mouillot 2008; HilleRisLambers et al. 2012; Kraft et al. 2015). Functional richness refers to the variability and relative frequency of different functional traits observed in a community. It is often used to estimate the strength of selection imposed by the environment (Kraft, Valencia, and Ackerly 2008; Kraft and Ackerly 2010; Kraft et al. 2015). High functional richness can indicate weak environmental selection whereas low functional richness can indicate strong selection (Kraft, Valencia, and Ackerly 2008; Halpern and Floeter 2008; Paine et al. 2011). In a multitrophic context, the effects of environmental selection can cascade to other trophic levels such that selection on consumer traits can shape the functional richness of their resources, modulated by their degree of reciprocal dependency or co-evolution (Lavorel et al. 2013; Guzman et al. 2019). Moreover, the same environmental gradient could exert selective pressures of different strength on communities at distinct trophic levels (Marjakangas et al. 2022). Differences in the strength of selective pressure among trophic levels could then possibly constrain the structure or topologies of trophic networks (Blüthgen et al. 2007; Schleuning et al. 2012; Dehling et al. 2014, 2020).\nInferring the relative strength of environmental selection between trophic levels requires high-dimensional approaches to deal with sparse observations for many species (Rohr et al. 2010; Strydom et al. 2022). We introduce the concept of functional trophic asymmetry (FTA), which allows inferring the relative influence of environmental selection and trait matching on the composition of multitrophic assemblages (Figure 1). FTA is the difference in the richness of interaction-relevant traits between trophic levels in a multitrophic network. FTA can occur because traits mediating species interactions (i.e., interaction niches) across trophic levels can also mediate the responses of species to their abiotic environment (i.e., environmental niches) (McCain and King 2014; Moretti and Legg 2009; Dehling et al. 2020). As an example, plant seed size determines the outcome of animal-mediated seed dispersal (Donoso et al. 2017, 2020) as well as physiological limits, such as tolerances of plant seedlings to desiccation (Hoekstra, Golovina, and Buitink 2001). High FTA could indicate differences in the strength of environmental selection over the interaction niches of distinct trophic levels within a multitrophic species assemblage. Alternatively, low FTA could indicate that the strength of the environment selection shaping interaction niches is similar between trophic levels, e.g., equally weak or equally strong (Marjakangas et al. 2022). When interactions between producers and consumers are mutualistic, low FTA could also emerge under strong trait matching and therefore indicate the influence of trait co-evolution during multitrophic community assembly (Dehling et al. 2014; Albrecht and Schleuning 2018). By studying spatial variation in FTA along environmental gradients, we sought for the conditions promoting environmentally versus cross-trophic interaction-driven community assembly (schleuning2020trait?; Bello, Schleuning, and Graham 2023).\nFrameworks linking multitrophic functional diversity to network topology along broad-scale environmental gradients are crucial to understand the effects of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem function (Bello, Schleuning, and Graham 2023; Dehling 2018; schleuning2020trait?; Schleuning et al. 2014; Schleuning, Garcı́a, and Tobias 2023). Functional responses of consumer and producer assemblages to climate influence functional richness at the level of the multitrophic community (Garcı́a, Donoso, and Rodrı́guez-Pérez 2018). Because some of these traits are involved in interactions across trophic levels, the filtering of traits along environmental gradients could constrain the identity, number, and frequency of species interactions, and therefore network topology (Marjakangas et al. 2022; Emer et al. 2020; Albrecht and Schleuning 2018). As an example, constraints of varying intensities along climatic gradients, which limit the relative availability of interaction partners across trophic levels, could influence emergent patterns of network structure such as the specialization of multispecies interactions (Blüthgen et al. 2007; Blüthgen, Menzel, and Blüthgen 2006; Marjakangas et al. 2022). While high levels of network specialization represent networks predominantly made of “one-to-one” interactions, low levels of network specialization represent networks with species showing predominantly “one-to-many” interactions (Blüthgen, Menzel, and Blüthgen 2006; Blüthgen and Klein 2011) (Figure 1B). One highly expected outcome is that when functional trophic asymmetry is high, networks will have low specialization. For example, take a plant community exhibiting a low richness of flower displays associated with a bee community (pollinators) exhibiting a wide variety of proboscis lengths. These plants are unlikely to form “one-to-one” interactions with only a subset of bees having matching proboscis length. Otherwise, non-matching pollinators would have no food resources and be extirpated. By partitioning deviations from expected FTA and network specialization relationships with null models, one can separate the relative influences of processes operating between trophic levels (e.g. trait matching) from those within trophic levels (e.g. environmental selection) in network assembly (Marjakangas et al. 2022). Despite this potential, the relationship between network specialization and functional trophic asymmetry has not been comprehensively explored.\nPreserving mutualistic interactions between palms and their mammalian frugivores is important to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem function in the tropics (Bogoni, Peres, and Ferraz 2020; Marques Dracxler and Kissling 2022). Mammalian frugivores facilitate the dispersal of palm fruits, which helps to prevent local extinctions amid disturbance and to maintain biodiversity in these ecological networks (Acevedo-Quintero et al. 2020; Messeder et al. 2020). To effectively preserve these interactions, it is crucial to understand how co-occurring palm (producer) and mammalian frugivore (consumer) communities respond to environmental gradients. By examining co-variation in their functional richness across broad geographic scales and linking those patterns to spatial and/or temporal variation in climate (Figure 2), we can identify key abiotic factors that influence the assembly of their mutualistic relationships. Here, we ask (1) which climatic variable(s) best explain(s) geographic variation in the functional richness of palms and mammalian frugivores, (2) whether differences in these relationships lead to FTA, and (3) which climatic variable best explains geographic variation in FTA across the Neotropics. We also ask (4) whether the strength of interactions between palm-frugivore interaction guilds relates to the strength of the relationship between FTA and climate, and (5) whether geographic variation in FTA relates to those of network specialization.",

    "text": "Figure 1: In ecological networks, bottom-up assembly refers to network structure being mainly shaped by the resource community, while top-down assembly reflects stronger influence from the consumer community. Although both processes may act together, their relative influence likely shifts along environmental gradients. This conceptual model illustrates the relationship between functional richness (FR) and functional trophic asymmetry (FTA) along environmental gradients and implications for network specialization. (a) Left: variation in FR for producers (depicted in green) and consumers (depicted in orange) along an environmental gradient. As environmental conditions become harsher along climatic gradients, it can result in a decline in functional richness due to stronger filtering of community composition. This decline can occur at different rates, leading to two scenarios: Top panel: differential decline in FR. If consumer FR declines more strongly than producer FR, it can indicate that the mode of network assembly is top-down. If producer FR declines more strongly than consumer FR, it can indicate that network assembly is bottom-up. This results in a substantial increase in FTA. Bottom panel: parallel decline in FR reflects both producer and consumer FRs reducing at a similar rate. FTA then remains relatively constant along the gradient. This scenario indicates a balanced impact of environmental changes across trophic levels, preserving the relative functional relationship between producers and consumers. (b) Network specialization indices can measure how generalized the interactions are between producers and consumers within ecological networks, revealing the role of changing FTA for network specialization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Workflow for integrating ecological, trait, and distributional data to model species interactions and infer ecological networks across geographic space. Digitally available information—including interaction records, trait measurements, and expert-based range maps—originate from literature, museum specimens, and field collections. These data streams are used in two main ways: (1) network parametrization using latent trait models (left panel), which estimate interaction probabilities (Pᵢⱼ) between palm and mammal species based on inferred compatibility in unobserved trait dimensions; and (2) trait linkage, where observed traits are statistically associated with latent traits to improve biological interpretability. Independently, species distribution data are used to assemble multitrophic communities (palm–mammal co-occurrence) within spatial grid cells (e.g. across the Neotropics). These grid-based assemblages are then combined with the interaction probability matrix (Pᵢⱼ) to infer local (grid cell) ecological networks. The outputs include palm–mammal interaction matrices (green–orange bipartite graphs) and derived network properties. The letters LP and POC represent two components of the generative model: Latent Probabilistic (LP) and Probability of Cooccurrence (POC), respectively, reflecting alternative formulations for generating spatialized interaction predictions.",

Palms (Plantae: Arecaceae) are a keystone plant family from tropical regions that provides fruit resources to a wide variety of vertebrate frugivores, including birds and mammals (Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard, and Kissling 2019; Zona and Henderson 1989). Frugivorous mammals (Animalia: Mammalia) are among the most important palm-seed dispersers, particularly over long distances. Most frugivorous mammals feeding on palms are seed eaters and pulp eaters, dispersing palm seeds mostly via ectozoochorus dispersal (Messeder et al. 2020; Marques Dracxler and Kissling 2022). Frugivory-related traits have notably underlain palm diversification and played a key role in the evolution of palm traits (Onstein et al. 2014, 2017)",

    "text": "2.3 Geographic distribution data\nWe obtained binary species distribution data (presence/absence) of palms from the geographic range maps of (Bjorholm et al. 2005) and on mammals from the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) data portal. To generate local gridded multitrophic species assemblages across the Neotropics, we intersected the species-level range maps with a spatial grid where each grid cell represented a 1 \\(\\times\\) 1 degree latitude and longitude resolution across the extent of the entire Neotropics. We then recorded all palm and mammal frugivore species occurring in each grid cell as our grid-cell level multitrophic assemblages.\n\n2.3.1 Trait data\nWe collected species-level multitrophic trait data related to the physiological tolerance of palms and frugivorous mammals to the abiotic environment and to their mutualistic interactions. For palms, we extracted data from the PalmTraits 1.0 dataset (Kissling et al. 2019). We collected data on growth form, maximum stem height, and average fruit length. For frugivorous mammals, we obtained trait data from the EltonTraits 1.0 database (Wilman et al. 2014). We selected data on body mass, diet, and daily activities. Diet data from the EltonTraits 1.0 database is coded as percentage use distribution across ten diet categories. We excluded from our analysis species without fruit in their diet. Activity was coded as a dummy variable with three categories (Diurnal, Crepuscular, Nocturnal). Finally, body mass was coded as a numerical variable in kg. We excluded bats from the analysis as almost no Neotropical bat species is feeding on palm fruits (Messeder et al. 2020). From this dataset, we selected only those species whose geographic range in the 1×1° latitude grid co-occurred with at least 5 other palm and mammal frugivore species. In total, we worked with a set of 494 palm species and 488 mammal frugivore species with linked trait and geographic data, which comprised respectively ~61% (Roncal et al. 2013; Balslev, Bernal, and Fay 2016) and ~64% (Fuzessy and Pizo 2025) of reported species for the Neotropics .\n\n\n2.3.2 Pairwise interaction data\nWe used data on seed dispersal interactions between palms and frugivorous mammals for the Neotropics, originating from recollections of seed dispersal records found in the published literature and interaction records recorded at the species level (Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard, and Kissling 2019). Each pairwise species interaction record reflects where an article mentions the fruit or the seed of a palm being dispersed, carried, or defecated by a frugivorous mammal. Interaction records collected in this database were previously vetted by (Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard, and Kissling 2019) to reflect effective seed dispersal interactions, while avoiding those that reflect mere seed consumption (vetting criteria found in: (Muñoz, Trøjelsgaard, and Kissling 2019)). In total, we gathered a total of 581 interaction records between 69 palms and 111 frugivore mammals.\n\n\n2.3.3 Climatic data\nWe used bioclimatic variables from WorldClim (Fick and Hijmans 2017) to represent large-scale spatial and temporal variation of climate in the Neotropics. Specifically, we used mean annual temperature (BIO01), total annual precipitation (BIO12), temperature seasonality (BIO04), and precipitation seasonality (BIO15). We selected these variables to represent the main axes of environmental niche variation shared by palms and frugivorous mammals (representing 91% of the total variance contained in the 19 WorldClim BIOCLIM variables). To harmonize spatial resolution with the scale of ecological analyses, each selected raster layer was aggregated by averaging approximately 34 neighboring cells into one while preserving broad-scale climatic gradients relevant to the study (i.e. 1 \\(\\times\\) 1 degree grid resolution).\n\n\n2.3.4 Statistical analysis\n\n2.3.4.1 Building a probabilistic Neotropical metaweb from aggregated binary interaction records\nWe fitted latent variable network structural models (Rohr et al. 2010; Terry and Lewis 2020) based on different underlying assumptions to infer interaction probabilities from binary observations of species interactions (Figure 3). Specifically, we tested the stochastic block model, the connectance model, the trait-matching model, and the matching-centrality model (Terry and Lewis 2020). The stochastic block model assumes that ecological networks are modular, with species of consumers interacting more within their preferred groups of producers (i.e., interaction guilds) than outside their preferred groups. This model outputs three incidence matrices, reflecting predicted interactions: (i) one with guilds of palm species based on their modular interactions with mammals, (ii) a similar one for mammals, and (iii) one representing the interaction probabilities (Theta) among the guilds of each group (i.e., palm guilds and mammal guilds, respectively). The connectance model posits that interactions of specialist species are subsets of those of generalist species and optimizes connectivity scores, constrained by this assumption, to recreate observed network patterns. The trait-matching model assumes non-random species interactions determined by trait differences, optimizing parameters along latent-trait axes. Finally, the matching-centrality model combines connectivity scores and latent-trait axes (Terry and Lewis 2020). Additional details about the model assumptions are explained in Supplementary B1. We fitted these models to our available interaction data and selected the model that best predicted the observed Neotropical pattern of seed dispersal interactions. Using Youden’s J as a metric that balanced model sensitivity and specificity (Poisot 2023), we found that the stochastic block model was the best supported model (Figure 3) and therefore focus on it in the rest of the manuscript.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Evaluation of four network assembly models to predict the binary structure of observed palm-mammal frugivory interactions in the Neotropics. (a) Region under the Curve (ROC) curves, (b,c) Youden’s J index, and (d) clustering heatmaps. The four models are the Centrality Model (CM), Trait Matching Model (TMM), Matching Centrality Model (MCM), and Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The ROC curves in (a) assess model performance through the relationship between model sensitivity (i.e. true positive rate) and model specificity (true negative rate). The curves above the diagonal demonstrate stronger predictive ability, showing that the model performs significantly better than random guesses in identifying ecological interactions. If a ROC curve is close to or below this diagonal, the model’s predictive performance is no better than random. The boxplot in (b) summarizes the Youden’s J index for each network assembly model, where higher values reflect higher overall predictive accuracy. In (c), the Youden’s J index shows variation over different probability thresholds to specify binary interactions. In (d), heatmaps highlight structural differences among the four models.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4.2 Identifying interactions guilds\nThe hyperparameters of the Stochastic Block Model provided the best fit for capturing the observed interactions, suggesting that palm - frugivorous mammal interaction networks are highly modular. Certain groups of producers were thus more likely to interact with certain groups of consumers than others, and vice versa. In this context, we define an interaction guild as a distinct group of palm and frugivorous mammal species within the Neotropical metaweb that exhibits similar interaction patterns, forming a module. Within each guild, both producer and resource species perform comparable functional roles in the network. Within and between each guild combination of consumers and producers, species pairs exhibit the same interaction strength, where interaction strength is defined as the magnitude or intensity of the effect that one species has on another within an ecological network. Here we estimate interaction strength as the probability that a species pair would interact in nature. The stochastic block model estimates such interaction probabilities based on the frequency of interactions observed between species assigned to a given guild of consumer or producer. The stochastic block model uses maximum likelihood to adjust the number of guilds and the distribution of interaction probabilities within and between guilds such that they best explain the observed pattern of interactions. Using stochastic block models largely reduces the complexity of dealing with pairwise interaction strengths by treating them as a guild-level phenomenon instead of a species-specific one. Importantly, there is no restriction for the stochastic model to assign palm or mammal species to every guild; consequently, some guilds may contain zero species within the Neotropical metaweb or a given grid cell. Our approach resulted in a theta matrix representing 7 x 7 latent guild combinations. In addition, we obtained a guild-association matrix for each trophic level. For frugivorous mammals, five guilds (guilds 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7) had at least one mammal species and two inferred guilds with no mammal species allocated to them (a.k.a empty guilds: 2, 5). For palms, we obtained four guilds (guilds 2, 3, 5, and 6) allocating at least one palm species and three empty guilds (1,3,7).\n\n\n2.3.4.3 Downscaling the Neotropical metaweb to generate grid-cell level networks\nThe availability of primary biodiversity data on palms and their frugivorous mammals was imbalanced, with a high availability of distribution ranges and species traits, but a limited number of interaction records. We therefore used a two-fold approach to downscale the initial, Neotropical metaweb to include interactions between every potentially co-occurring palm and mammal frugivore in every grid cell across the Neotropics.\nFirst, we employed multinomial logistic regression models using neural networks to predict the interaction guild affiliation of each species from the stochastic block model results using species-level trait data. We justify the choice of multinomial logistic regression models as these can handle the prediction of non-binary outcomes, such as the labeling of interaction guilds per species. Separate multinomial logistic regression models using a single-hidden layer network were fitted for palms and frugivorous mammals, respectively (Ripley, Venables, and Ripley 2016) with 75% of the data allocated for training and the remaining 25% for testing. This approach is useful when dealing with multicollinearity, as it can learn complex and non-linear relationships and interactions among multiple predictor variables. This allowed us to separate the relative importance of distinct matching traits from the stochastic block model group affiliations. We extracted variable importance scores based on combinations of the absolute values of the best fit model weights (Gevrey, Dimopoulos, and Lek 2003).\nSecond, we considered local pairwise species interaction probabilities as the product of the values from the Theta matrix from the stochastic block model that represents the latent interaction probabilities between species pairs within and between guilds multiplied by their probability of co-occurrence in a grid cell. To represent species’ co-occurrence probabilities, we calculated a spatial overlap index for each species pair as the product of their relative range areas, normalized by the sum of their areas. Additionally, we computed the geographic distance between species’ range centroids and rescaled these distances to a 0–1 scale, with proximity increasing interaction weight. The final interaction weight for each species pair was computed as the product of the rescaled SBM-derived probability, the rescaled spatial overlap index, and the inverse of the rescaled geographic distance. In other words, grid-level interaction probabilities represent the biological feasibility of a pairwise interaction given the regional availability of their traits (Strydom et al. 2022), with the overall assumption of higher species abundances toward the center of their geographic ranges (Schmidt et al. 2022)\n\n\n2.3.4.4 Estimating functional richness\nFunctional richness (FR) is typically defined as the variability and relative frequency of functional traits within a community (Kraft, Valencia, and Ackerly 2008; Kraft and Ackerly 2010). The interaction guilds identified by the stochastic block model encapsulate unique combinations of functional traits reflected in species interactions. Consequently, the guild affiliation itself represents a categorical multitrophic “functional trait syndrome” for our analysis. For each grid cell, we calculated the proportion of palm and mammal species belonging to each guild (n = 7) relative to the total number of palm or mammal species present locally. This normalization ensures that our measure reflects trait diversity rather than simply species richness. Thus, our metric of FR quantifies the diversity of functional roles occupied by palms and mammals within local networks, aligning conceptually with broader ecological definitions of FR but adapted to multitrophic assemblages through the latent trait representation provided by the stochastic block model. We assigned a value of FR = 0 to those guilds with no palm or mammal species present.\n\n\n2.3.4.5 Estimating functional trophic asymmetry\nWe quantified FTA as the absolute difference in functional richness between palm and frugivorous mammal assemblages within each of the 1,242 grid cells. The FTA measure for each grid cell was obtained by computing the absolute difference between guild-specific functional richness values across the two trophic levels, resulting in one FTA value per guild combination per grid cell. This approach resulted in 43 unique realized pairwise guild combinations, after excluding 6 combinations where both guilds lacked species representation in the Neotropical metaweb. Overall, 98% of all available guild combinations exhibited nonzero FTA values across grid cells, indicating that only 2% of potential palm–mammal guild interactions from the metaweb were locally absent. To estimate a single grid-cell level metric of functional trophic asymmetry, we summed the FTA values across all interaction guilds, weighted by their respective interaction strengths (FTAsum). This approach was chosen as it accounts for the uneven contributions of each guild to network structure.\n\n\n2.3.4.6 Estimating network specialization\nWe estimated network specialization for each grid cell using the metric H2’. H2’ is a network-level index that varies between 0 and 1 (Blüthgen et al. 2007). High values indicate networks that are more specialized, meaning that species from one trophic level interact with only one or just a few species in the other trophic level. Low H2’ values indicate that there is a low specificity of interactions in the network, meaning that species from one trophic level interact with multiple species of the other trophic level. Because inferred networks varied in their network size (i.e., number of unique interactions between palms and frugivorous mammals), we rarefied the H2’ computed for each grid-cell level network such that they would all have the same size (i.e., number of interactions). Specifically, we rarefied all networks to 100 pairwise interactions and repeated the procedure 999 times to get a distribution of rarefied H2’ values (Terry and Lewis 2020). We then selected the median of this H2’ distribution as our grid cell-level measure of network specialization.\n\n\n2.3.4.7 Assessing the influence of climate on FTA\nTo assess whether climate has an influence on FTA, we fitted a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to examine the relationships between FTA and the four bioclimatic predictors described above. The GAM approach allows for modelling flexible non-linear relationships between the predictors and the response variable using smoothed penalized functions (Wood 2017). We fitted separate splines for each climatic predictor.\n\n\n2.3.4.8 Assessing how interaction strength mediates the influence of climate on FTA\nIn our approach, interaction strength represents the estimated frequency of interactions between species assigned to a given guild of consumer or producer, that is, the values from the theta matrix from the SBM (Figure S1). To assess whether the strength of interactions between producer and consumer guilds mediates the relationship between FTA and climate, we included “interaction strength” as an interaction term in the GAM, allowing splines between FTA and climate to vary non-linearly depending on the strength of interaction among guilds.\n\n\n2.3.4.9 Assessing the relationship between FTA and H2’\nWe used a GAM to investigate the relationship between rarefied grid-cell network specialization (H2’) as a response variable and FTA (z-scores) as the main predictor. We also added covariate functions to account for the effect of mean annual temperature, total annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and temperature seasonality because these climate variables may influence H2’ independently of FTA. This allowed us to isolate the specific impact of FTA on H2’ while controlling for the indirect effects of climate on FTA.",

    "section": "2.4 Results",
    "text": "2.4 Results\n\n2.4.1 Interaction guild delineation\nThe result of our modelling approach was one theta matrix reflecting the modular pattern of interaction guilds in the Neotropical metaweb (Figure S1) and two association matrices linking frugivorous mammals (Figure S2a) and palms (Figure S2b) to their interaction guilds. Together, they represent high-level trait-trait associations between trophic levels. Specifically: a) Tall palms with medium-sized fruits (p3) are strongly associated with small to medium sized mammals that consume moderate to high amounts of fruit (m1). b) Acaulescent or small-stemmed palms with small to large fruits (p6) correlate strongly with small mammals with relatively low frugivory (m3). Finally, c) medium-sized to large sized frugivorous mammals with moderate to low frugivory levels (m6) interact with moderately tall erect palms with medium-sized fruits (p5). Our approach resulted in 1287 grid cells across the Neotropics, each containing seven measures of functional richness (FR) for palms and seven measures for mammals, corresponding to each interaction guild within the two trophic levels. Across all grid cells, mammalian frugivore guild m3 dominated (54 % ± 9), comprising 341 species of relatively small-bodied frugivores (mean 4.75 ± 1.33 kg) with low fruit intake (21.7 ± 7.2 %) and predominantly nocturnal habits (84 % nocturnal, 22 % diurnal). Its counterpart in palms (p3) was much smaller (just 15 species) but consisted of the tallest stems (3.45 ± 0.26 m) bearing the largest fruits (1.69 ± 0.40 cm). Mammalian frugivore guild m6 (15 % ± 5) included 15 of the largest frugivores (9.73 ± 0.73 kg) with moderate frugivory (20 ± 12.5 %) and mixed activity patterns (40 % diurnal, 73 % nocturnal, 47 % crepuscular); its counterpart palm assemblage (p6) (137 species) was dominated by short‐stemmed, large‐fruited forms (1.18 ± 0.96 m; 1.39 ± 0.57 cm) with a high proportion of acaulescent growth (36 %). Smaller frugivorous mammal assemblages in mammalian guilds m1 (12 % ± 4) and m7 (10 % ± 4) comprised 66 and 33 species, respectively: m1 species were moderately sized (6.47 ± 1.68 kg), highly frugivorous (64.1 ± 11.6 %) and evenly split between diurnal and nocturnal, whereas m7 species were larger (8.15 ± 0.52 kg), moderately frugivorous (36.4 ± 4.9 %) and mostly diurnal (79 %). Guild m4 (9 % ± 5) included 33 small (3.91 ± 0.66 kg), highly frugivorous mammals (48.5 ± 3.6 %) that were almost exclusively nocturnal (97 %). Among palms, guild p5 dominated (46 % ± 15) with 265 low‐stature (understory), erect stemmed palms (1.95 ± 0.63 m; 0.90 ± 0.31 cm fruits; 1 % acaulescent), followed by guild p6 (34 % ± 18) and guild p3 (10 % ± 7), while guilds p1, p4 and p7 had no palm representatives (Table S4, Figure S2a, S2b).\n\n\n2.4.2 Assessing the influence of climate on functional richness\nOverall, the functional richness of palm interaction guilds showed a weak association with climatic gradients (Table S1, Figure S3). Only mean annual temperature had a significant positive effect (estimate = 4.07e−04, P = 0.0027), while precipitation (P = 0.23), temperature seasonality (P = 0.79), and precipitation seasonality (P = 0.50) showed no significant effects (Table S1). In contrast, the functional richness of mammal interaction guilds was significantly and positively related to temperature (estimate = 4.42e−04, P &lt; 0.001), but unrelated to precipitation (P = 0.15), temperature seasonality (P = 0.63), or precipitation seasonality (P = 0.13) (Table S2). However, when using smoothed terms for separating the effects of climate across individual interaction guilds, we found significant correlations (Table S1). Mean annual temperature had a significant nonlinear effect for palm guild p3 (F = 6.30, P = 0.014), whose functional richness declined with increasing temperature. Several other guilds (m1, m4, m5, m7) showed marginally significant temperature effects (P &lt; 0.1), but responses were weak and inconsistent in direction. Significant precipitation effects were only observed for palm guild p6 (F = 2.95, P = 0.0067), which showed a positive association, indicating increased functional richness of short-stemmed or acaulescent palms in wetter environments. No other guilds showed a statistically significant relationship with precipitation. For precipitation seasonality, statistically significant responses were observed for palm guild p5 (F = 8.37, P = 0.0070) and IG-6 (F = 5.62, P = 0.0011). These had opposite directions: p5 functional richness decreased with higher seasonality, while it increased for p6. No guild showed statistically significant effects of temperature seasonality (P &gt; 0.35 for all) (Figure 4a, Figure S1, Table S1). At the opposite trophic level, mean annual temperature emerged as the only statistically significant climatic driver, with significant nonlinear effects for mammalian guilds m1 (F = 6.66, P = 0.011), m2 (F = 6.91, P = 0.010), m4 (F = 11.21, P = 0.001), m5 (F = 6.91, P = 0.010), m6 (F = 10.33, P = 0.0016), and m7 (F = 9.02, P = 0.0032). Visual inspection of the partial effect plots revealed that all statistically significant guilds exhibited declining functional richness with increasing temperature, suggesting a negative nonlinear response within guilds (Figure 4a, Figure S1, Table S2).\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Relationships between environmental gradients and functional richness, functional trophic asymmetry of mutualistic palm-mammal frugivore networks in the Neotropics. Figure panels a and b illustrate how functional richness (left) and functional trophic asymmetry (FTA; right) of palm–mammal frugivore guilds vary along two climatic gradients. In panel a (top), mammal guilds (red lines) show relatively flat functional richness across mean annual temperature, whereas palm guilds (green lines) diverge: guild IG-3p increases sharply toward warmer areas while IG-5m and IG-6m remain constant. In the lower‐left panel, functional richness declines with increasing precipitation seasonality in mammal guilds IG-3m, IG-4m, and IG-7m, but palm guild IG-6p increases, reflecting a shift toward more functionally diverse short‐stemmed species under seasonal rainfall. Panel b (top) reveals that FTA of certain mammal‐only guilds (e.g. m3p3 in yellow and m3p6 in red) steadily rises with temperature, while other guilds remain unchanged. The bottom‐right panel shows a more complex mosaic under precipitation seasonality, with some guilds (m5p6, m4p6) displaying stronger asymmetry in highly seasonal environments and others (m1p6, m7p6) remaining stable. Together, these plots underscore that palms and mammalian frugivores respond idiosyncratically to climatic gradients, and that the balance of their trait distributions can be either buffered or exacerbated by temperature and rainfall seasonality depending on the interaction guild.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Assessing the influence of climate on functional trophic asymmetry\nThe distribution of grid cell measures of functional trophic asymmetry varied significantly among interaction guilds in palm–mammal frugivore networks (Figures 4b). The highest asymmetries were observed in guild combinations (m = mammals, p = palms) such as m3p7, m3p4, and m3p1, indicating strong differences between functional traits of palms and associated mammalian frugivores. In contrast, guilds like m7p2, m4p3, and m7p3 showed markedly lower functional trophic asymmetry values (Figure S4). The weighted sum of guild-level Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTAsum), which summarizes FTA variation across all interaction guilds, averaged 0.91 across all grid cells (SD = 0.10), with values ranging from 0.67 to 1.28 (Figure S6). FTAsum was positively correlated with mean annual temperature and precipitation seasonality. In other words, greater differences in the functional richness between trophic levels peaked in warm and regions with seasonal rainfall (Figure 5, Figure 6). Functional trophic asymmetry was positively related to mean annual temperature across all interaction guilds (F = 5.97, P = 0.01). However, no consistent relationships were found with precipitation (F = 0.28, P = 0.13), precipitation seasonality (F = 0.30, P = 0.59), or temperature seasonality (F = 0.19, P = 0.67) (Table 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Spatial variation of functional trophic asymmetry (FTAsum) and network-level specialization (H2′) across the Neotropics. Panels a & b shows the spatial variation of climatic predictors, i.e. (a) mean annual temperature, and (b) precipitation seasonality. Panel (c) shows FTAsum, which quantifies the disparity in functional richness between interacting trophic levels, with higher values (red) indicating greater asymmetry. Panel (d) displays H2′, a standardized measure of interaction specialization, where higher values (red) represent more specialized networks. The figure illustrates how broad‐scale climate gradients shape overall functional‐trait mismatch (FTAsum) and network specialisation (H2′) in Neotropical palm–mammal frugivore assemblages. In panel a, mean annual temperature (MAT) peaks above 28 °C in lowland Amazonia and Atlantic Forest and falls below 10 °C in the high Andes, while precipitation seasonality (PS) is lowest (&lt; 30 mm) in the ever-wet Amazon and exceeds 120 mm in seasonally dry forests.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The variation of functional trophic asymmetry and network specialization for palm-mammal frugivore seed dispersal networks across climatic gradients in the Neotropics. Panels show partial effects (±95 % CI) of a generalized additive model: FTAsum increases steadily with mean annual temperature, indicating greater functional trophic asymmetry in warmer areas, but is effectively flat across the precipitation seasonality gradient. By contrast, H2′ remains low and invariant up to ~18 °C before rising at higher mean annual temperature, increasing monotonically with precipitation seasonality, indicating more specialised interactions under pronounced rainfall seasonality.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Assessing how interaction strength mediates the influence of climate on functional trophic asymmetry\nThe strength of interactions between guilds of consumers and producers had an overall positive but weak effect on functional trophic asymmetry (Figure 4b, Figure S7, Table S3). Moreover, we did not find strong evidence supporting that the relationship between functional trophic asymmetry and climate depends on the strength of interaction between interaction guilds (F = 746, P &gt; 0.05) (Figure S7, Table 1). The interaction term between guild interaction strength and precipitation seasonality had a marginally significant positive effect on functional trophic asymmetry (F = 0.14, P = 0.051) (Figure S8, Table 1). Assessing the relationship between functional trophic asymmetry and network specialization We found that palm–mammal frugivore networks exhibited moderate to occasionally high levels of trophic specialization, with H2′ values ranging from 0.08 to 0.79 (median = 0.21), where 0 means that species have no preference for their interaction partners and 1 represents specialized networks where each species interacts only with a specific subset of interaction partners (Figure S9). H2′ was positively associated with the functional trophic asymmetry index (FTAsum) (β = 0.047, P = 0.002; Table S3), indicating that networks with greater asymmetry between consumer and resource traits tended to be more specialized (Figure 6, Figure S9). In addition, H2′ was significantly related to mean annual temperature (F = 3.39, P = 0.005) and precipitation seasonality (F = 3.13, P = 0.003), suggesting that environmental gradients shape patterns of trophic specialization (Figure 6). In contrast, H2′ showed no significant association with temperature seasonality or total annual precipitation (P &gt; 0.2). The full model explained 4.5% of the H2’ deviance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary of parametric and smooth term coefficients for the model predicting FTA responses to climate.\n\n\n\nThe only parametric term inferred was for the intercept, and we provide its coefficient estimate, standard error, t-value, and p-value.

    "section": "2.5 Discussion",
    "text": "2.5 Discussion\nOur study reveals that the functional traits relevant to trophic interactions are subject to different relative strengths of environmental filtering among trophic levels, and over space in the Neotropics. In palm-mammal frugivore assemblages, these differences (a.k.a. functional trophic asymmetry) reach their maximum in areas with warm climates and highly seasonal precipitations. Furthermore, multitrophic species assemblages with high FTA paradoxically exhibited a high level of specialization in their trophic interaction networks. Taken together, our results suggest that distinct community assembly processes operate across trophic levels, reinforcing the idea that network assembly emerges from a dynamic interplay of bottom-up (producer driven) and top-down (consumer driven) processes (Moretti and Legg 2009); Marjakangas et al. (2022); Schleuning, Garcı́a, and Tobias (2023)] , whose respective contributions are dependent on the environmental and biotic conditions.\n\n2.5.1 Contrasting trait-mediated responses to environmental variation across trophic levels\nConsumer and producer assemblages are known to differ in their functional response to climatic gradients (Moretti and Legg 2009; Dehling et al. 2014; Albrecht and Schleuning 2018; Song and Spaak 2024). In our Neotropical palm-frugivore study system, changes in functional trophic asymmetry along the temperature gradient were primarily driven by consumers (mammalian frugivores), reflecting an increased representation of frugivores with a low proportion of fruit in their diet in warmer are-as. Along with the precipitation seasonality gradient, shifts in functional trophic asymmetry were producer-driven, linked to a decline in short-stature (understory) palms with low to medium fruit sizes and a concurrent rise in short-stemmed (acaulescent) palms bearing medium to large fruits (Figure 4). For mammalian frugivores, functional richness generally responded to the tempera-ture gradient, except for the guild representing small-bodied frugivores (IG-3), which exhibited relative stability across the gradient. These small-bodied frugivores can be primarily seed preda-tors rather than effective seed dispersers. As such, they may also be contributing more to antag-onistic than mutualistic outcomes in palm–frugivore interactions (Marques Dracxler and Kissling 2022) (Table S1). Palm responses are more tightly coupled to variation in precipitation seasonality and total annual precipitation, with both the shape and strength of these responses varying among guilds. Notably, there is a functional shift towards warmer regions with high precipitation seasonality, where palms with relatively small fruits (p5) are replaced by palms bearing relatively large fruits (p6). This pattern is consistent with previous studies showing that palm assemblages in regions with strong climatic seasonality and long dry periods tend to have larger fruit sizes in addition to a reduced species richness, likely an adaptive response to historical climatic fluctuations during the Quaternary (Kissling et al. 2012; Göldel, Kissling, and Svenning 2015).\n\n\n2.5.2 Top-down and bottom-up variations in functional trophic asymmetry are mediated by climate\nFunctional trophic asymmetry varied geographically, peaking in warm regions with high seasonal precipitation. Overall, average annual temperature has a small but positive effect on functional trophic asymmetry. The effect on functional trophic asymmetry was explained by larger temperature-driven shifts in the functional richness of mammals than in that of palms. These results support the view that the assembly of palm-frugivore networks inhabiting the warmest regions of the Neotropics is predominantly top-down (i.e., consumer-driven). In contrast, the detected influence of precipitation seasonality on the functional richness of palm assemblages supports the view that the assembly of palm- mammalian sfrugivore networks in areas with highly seasonal precipitations is mostly bottom-up (i.e., producer-driven) (Schleuning et al. 2016; Albrecht and Schleuning 2018; Marjakangas et al. 2022; Dehling et al. 2020).\nInteraction strength, that is, the intensity of the effect that one species has on another within an ecological network, varies strongly across palms and mammalian frugivore guilds. Moreover, variations in the strength of interaction among palm-frugivore guilds mediate the response of functional trophic asymmetry to precipitation seasonality. Specifically, the level of functional trophic asymmetry in strongly interacting guilds shows a more significant and positive relationship with precipitation seasonality. This means, for example, that palm species from guilds with more specialized seed dispersal are more common while palm species from guilds with a generalist seed dispersal strategy become rarer towards regions where rainfall is seasonal (Figure 4b, Figure 6). As precipitation becomes more seasonal, Neotropical palms are represented by species with larger fruits (Kissling et al. 2012) and mammalian frugivores with a broad diet become scarcer. For instance, the biomass of frugivorous primates is generally lower in seasonal environments with marked fruiting periods (Hanya et al. 2011). Our results align with findings of bat-plant mutualistic pollination networks, where interacting species exhibit lower niche overlaps in highly seasonal environments, and with those of avian-frugivory networks where weaker trait matching is found towards the tropics (Schleuning et al. 2012; Huang, Dalsgaard, and Chen 2025). They also contrast with others that report stronger trait-matching and interaction strength towards the tropics in plant-hummingbird pollination networks (Sonne et al. 2020) and avian-palm frugivory networks (McFadden et al. 2022). While our results are directly relevant to palm-mammal seed dispersal interactions, the diversity of process across mutualistic systems highlights the context dependency of trait–interaction-climate relationships. As such, generalizations about the functional ecology of mutualistic networks should pay attention to partner identity and interaction type.\n\n\n2.5.3 Functional trophic asymmetry as a multitrophic indicator of ecological processes and their response to global changes\nThe concept of functional trophic asymmetry offers a valuable framework to examine how multitrophic ecological communities respond to shifting environmental conditions. Functional trophic asymmetry captures how environmental filtering differentially affects producers and consumers, revealing the contributions of bottom-up and top-down processes in shaping ecological network structure. While past studies have largely focused on single-trophic responses to climate or trait matching within networks, the framework we present here combines network assembly modeling with trait-based analyses, facilitating the generation of multiscale synthetic species interaction data, as well as ecological interpretations of broad-scale multitrophic community assembly pat-terns within a single framework. In addition to climate change, habitat destruction, defaunation, and other human-induced landscape modifications can independently alter resource and consumer functional diversity, thereby affecting functional trophic asymmetry (Guevara et al. 2023; Bello, Schleuning, and Graham 2023; Guerra et al. 2025). Although differences in the extent of landscape modification were not directly investigated in this study, previous research in plant-hummingbird mutualisms (i.e. pollination) shows that deforestation has a greater impact on the diversity and redundancy of functional roles in plants than in their pollinators, suggesting a de-cline in plant functional roles as forests are lost (Tinoco, Santillán, and Graham 2018; Guevara et al. 2023).\nFuture work may focus on integrating additional information such as geographic variation in population density, land-use change, or spatial movement data (e.g., GPS tracking of frugivores) that would improve realism and generalization of our modelling approach to generate synthetic ecological networks (Borah and Beckman 2022; Beumer et al. 2025; Cousens et al. 2010). For instance, the assumption of higher species abundances toward the center of geographic ranges could be challenged, as spatial patterns in species abundance might depend on how geographic ranges are aligned with background environmental gradients (Schmidt et al. 2022). Moreover, the role and importance of some individual consumer species in plant-animal seed dispersal networks (e.g. species’ centrality) might vary with the distance to their climatic niche centroid, suggesting the existence of areas where ecological and evolutionary dynamics might be elevated (Moulatlet et al. 2025). New elements such as these could be integrated into the analytical pipelines once sufficient relevant data becomes digitally available.",

    "section": "2.6 Conclusion",
    "text": "2.6 Conclusion\nAs climate change accelerates, rising temperatures and altered precipitation regimes are likely to increase functional trophic asymmetry in multitrophic palm-frugivore communities and increase specialization in palm seed dispersal networks. A likely consequence is also the loss of ecosystem function, in particular the zoochorous dispersal of palm propagules between habitat patches, which has been shown to decrease with increased specialization and reduced plant functional diversity (Landim et al. 2025). Such structural changes may also arise in other mutualistic net-work systems supporting key ecosystem functions, including pollination, myrmecochory, and plant-soil microbiome networks (Schleuning et al. 2014; schleuning2020trait?). These could similarly experience reduced functional connectivity and lower resilience due to increased specialization and declining functional diversity under climate change (Donoso et al. 2017; CaraDonna et al. 2021; Cruz et al. 2023). However, future research should explicitly test these predictions across different ecological systems to better understand the generality and scale of these impacts (Landim et al. 2025, 2025; Rabeau et al. 2025; Acosta-Rojas et al. 2023). As species distributions shift in response to climate change (Aizen, Sabatino, and Tylianakis 2012; Valiente-Banuet et al. 2015; Bartley et al. 2019; Hurtado, Montoya, and Stouffer 2024), our work showcases the potential role of functional trophic asymmetry as a key framework to advance our ability to predict shifts in ecosystem function (Montoya, Pimm, and Solé 2010; Bello et al. 2023; Heilmeier 2019) with incomplete multi-trophic data on species interactions and traits.\n\n\n\n\nAcevedo-Quintero, Juan Fernando, Romeo A Saldaña-Vázquez, Eduardo Mendoza, and Joan Gastón Zamora-Abrego. 2020. “Sampling Bias Affects the Relationship Between Structural Importance and Species Body Mass in Frugivore-Plant Interaction Networks.” Ecological Complexity 44: 100870.\n\n\nAckerly, David D. 2003. “Community Assembly, Niche Conservatism, and Adaptive Evolution in Changing Environments.” International Journal of Plant Sciences 164 (S3): S165–84.\n\n\nAcosta-Rojas, Diana C, Maciej Barczyk, Carlos I Espinosa, Boris A Tinoco, Eike L Neuschulz, and Matthias Schleuning. 2023. “Climate and Microhabitat Shape the Prevalence of Endozoochory in the Seed Rain of Tropical Montane Forests.” Biotropica 55 (2): 408–17.\n\n\nAizen, Marcelo A., Malena Sabatino, and Jason M.

    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nThe biological diversity we see today has assembled over millions of years with evolutionary processes unfolding together with global climate change across geological time. Yet, modern studies investigating the effects of climate change on biodiversity assembly often share a focus on contemporary patterns and processes (Ackerly 2003; Kraft et al. 2015; Harrison, Spasojevic, and Li 2020). Although it is possible to derive some inference on the role of long-term evolutionary and historical processes from “one-time snapshots” of current biodiversity patterns  (Harrison, Spasojevic, and Li 2020; Chang and HilleRisLambers 2016), these contemporary patterns offer limited insights (Cadotte & Tucker 2017; Emerson & Gillespie 2008; Jackson & Blois 2015; Blois et al., 2014). A better understanding of evolutionary and historical processes is critical for biogeography, which focuses on the assembly of biodiversity at broad spatial scale (Cornell & Harrison 2014). The formation of global biogeographic regions, for example, is often attributed to plate tectonics movement and historical climate (Mazel et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the growing availability of spatially and temporally explicit biodiversity and paleoclimatic data, despite their heterogeneity and noise, creates an opportunity infer and model biodiversity assembly processes in deep time  (Kocsis et al., 2021; Briega-Alvarez et al., 2025).\nOver deep time, influences on modern biodiversity can be tracked in repeated episodes of extinction, diversification, and biodiversity reorganization (Albert & Carvalho 2011; Morales-Garcia 2020; Daru et al., 2017). Fossil records in deep time provide a window into those evolutionary episodes (Jackson & Blois 2015; DiMichele et al., 2004; Erwin 2009) and additional insights into processes that extend well beyond the Quaternary (0-2.8Ma) (Blanco et al. 2021; Mottl et al. 2021; Jabot et al. 2020). Digitally available fossil datasets with geo-chrono-referenced fossil records (e.g. NOW, PBDB fossil databases) (Vzliobaite et al., 2023) open new opportunities for modelling the assembly of biodiversity across the geological time scale (Jablonski & Shubin 2015; Blanco et al. 2021; Mottl et al. 2021; Jabot et al. 2020). When integrated with spatiotemporal paleoclimatic reconstructions, these fossil records can reveal how planetary climate change shaped biodiversity in the absence anthropogenic stressors (Chang & HilleRisLambers 2016; DiMichele et al., 2004; Lyons & Wagner 2009).\nAt least two complementary attributes of paleoclimatic dynamics could have influenced the assembly of regional biodiversity in deep time. First, the magnitude of directional climatic change between adjacent geological periods, expressed as the velocity of climate change per unit of time (Zachos et al., 2001; Galvan et al., 2025). Second, the climatic instability, expressed as variation in climate within each geological period (Vrba, 1992; Dynesius & Jansson, 2000; Finnegan et al., 2015).  The Neogene (23Ma – 2Ma), saw the emergence of many modern plant and animal families, as well as the extinction of many others that were previously widespread during the Paleogene (66Ma – 23 Ma) (Costeur et al., 2004). During this period, the Earth’s climate transitioned from a greenhouse to an icehouse state, culminating in the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation around 2-3 million Ma (Kennett et al., 1995). Climate change magnitude and climate instability across the Neogene could have jointly shaped the assembly of regional biodiversity via their influence on dispersal, speciation and extinction dynamics (Erwin 2009; Ding et al. 2025; neubauer2022short?)\nHigh climate change magnitude could increase change in the composition of regional biotas by triggering speciation events and/or increasing extinctions rates.  Climate-driven species factories (Stebbins 1974; Bernor et al., 1996; Eronen et al., 2012) can emerge in regions with high climate change magnitude (such as increasing aridity or cooling), where preadapted taxa gain a competitive advantage, diversify, and give rise to new lineages suited to the conditions of the near future. For example, during the gradual cooling of Earth during the Neogene (23Ma – 2Ma), ecosystems transition from warm evergreen subtropical woodlands to cooler, more seasonal deciduous forests (Jablonski, 2008; Barnosky et al., 2011; Reddin et al., 2020), many forest-adapted mammal taxa declined or went extinct, while open-habitat specialists such as bovids and equids expanded through adaptive radiations driven by ecological specialization (Jernvall & Fortelius 2002; Raia et al. 2011).  As North America became drier than Eurasia during the middle Miocene–Pliocene, arid-adapted groups such as horses, camels, and canids evolved there first and later invaded the Old World.  In addition, directional shifts in climate change such as the transitions between prolonged warming and cooling phases (or vice versa) can precipitate extinction cascades but also promote adaptive reorganizations (Pinsky et al., 2025; Lewthwaite et al., 2017; Kiessling et al., 2024) depending on how rapidly populations and traits respond to the climatic change shift (Benton & Pearson, 2001; Pimm et al., 1988). Morphological and genetic data show that climate-driven changes in temperature, aridity, and productivity influence body size, tooth morphology, and dispersal, often with temporal lags in the evolutionary response (MacFadden, 2000; Hadly et al., 2004), making transitional periods especially prone to ecological disequilibrium and elevated turnover (Guerin et al., 2013; Fitzpatrick et al., 2013).\nIn contrast to climate-driven species factories, low turnover rates are expected within climatically stable regions. In climatically stable regions, extinction and speciation rates tend to be lower due to species populations being less fragmented and experiencing homogeneous environmental pressures (Vasconcelos et al., 2021). Turnover may be driven mainly by species immigrants seeking refuge away from regions with periods of intense climatic change (Fortelius & Zhang, 2006; Casanovas-Vilar et al., 2010; Vasconcelos et al., 2021). For instance, during the Miocene (23Ma-5Ma), the Iberian Peninsula acted as a climatic oasis where suids, bovids, and small carnivores persisted after going extinct elsewhere in Europe (Casanovas-Vilar et al., 2010; Fortelius et al., 2014). Its stable climate led to low turnover, with most newcomers arriving via dispersal from Africa or Central Europe rather than local speciation (Agustí & Antón, 2002). In contrast to species factories, which are macroevolutionary sources of diversification (Fortelius et al., 2014), climatically stable regions act as macroevolutionary sinks, preserving past diversity with limited contribution to future radiations (Stebbins 1974; Fortelius et al., 2014; Mirzaie Ataabadi et al., 2013; Vasconcelos et al., 2021).\nHere, we examine alternative hypotheses regarding the role of climate dynamics in driving the turnover of mammalian fossil assemblage during the Neogene (Figure 1). Specifically, A) regions experiencing low levels of directional climatic change (i.e. magnitude) and high levels of instability are expected to show minimal fossil turnover (Figure 1a.A, Figure 1b.A) (H1-stability), whereas those experiencing B) a high magnitude of climate change and low instability are expected to show elevated rates of turnover. (Figure 1a.B, Figure 1b.B) (H2-directional change). Finally, C) a low magnitude of climate change and high instability may generate episodic pulses of turnover without sustained faunal replacement (Figure 1a.C, Figure 1b.C) (H3-Oscillatory climate). D) When both climatic magnitude and instability are high, their effects may compound, producing accelerated and recurrent turnover as ecosystems experience rapid and irregular environmental shifts. (Figure 1a.D, Figure 1b.D) (H4- compound instability).",

    "section": "3.2 Methods",
    "text": "3.2 Methods\n\n3.2.1 Fossil and paleoclimate data sources\n\n3.2.1.1 Fossil occurrence data\nWe gathered large-mammal fossil data from the NOW database (Vzliobaite et al., 2023). Fossils of large mammals are particularly useful to uncover macro-evolutionary trends as they can preserve biogeographical patterns with high spatial fidelity (Darroch et al., 2021). Moreover, the results of centuries of paleontological research are now digitally available in aggregated fossil databases with standardized taxonomic nomenclature and geotagged records. Our queried subset of the database contained 18349 species level fossil records spanning six (6) mammal orders: Artiodactyla (40%), Carnivora (26%), Perissodactylia (24%), Primates (1.5%), and Proboscidea (8.6%). We excluded records a) georeferenced outside the North America and Europe continents (3068 records), and b) where the genus was classified as indeterminate (“indet.”) (4215 records). We ended with a total of 11066 species level fossil records (Table S1).To reduce taxonomic bias in sampling completeness we focused subsequent analyses in records aggregated to the genus level, obtaining a total of unique 6843 genus-level fossil space-time observations.\n\n\n3.2.1.2 Defining the temporal and spatial scope of fossil records\nTemporally, we binned individual fossil records to their corresponding Neogene epochs based on the mid-point between the maximum and minimum radiocarbon-based age estimates that are reported in the NOW database. We consider the following temporal boundaries to the Neogene epochs: The Aquitanian (23–21 Ma), Burdigalian (20–16 Ma), Langhian (15–14 Ma) and Serravallian (13–12 Ma), Tortonian (11–8 Ma), and Messinian (7–5 Ma), Zanclean (5–4 Ma) and Piacenzian (3–2 Ma) (Kennett et al., 1995).\nSpatially, we used the ‘grid’ method to transform present-day geographic fossil coordinates and associated age estimates were projected to a discrete global grid defined separately for each Neogene epoch. These time-specific grids were rotated in one-million-year increments across the Phanerozoic (540–0 Ma) using the MERDITH2021 plate reconstruction model (Merdith et al. 2021; Jones et al., 2024), thereby correcting for underlying plate tectonic shifts in deep time and generating paleo-coordinates for all fossil observations.  To do this, we used the paleorotate() function from the paleoverse R package v1.4.0 (Jones et al., 2023) (Figure S1).\n\n\n3.2.1.3 Defining fossil paleo-assemblages\nWe used a hexagonal equal-area grid to assign fossil paleo coordinates to spatial bins representing fossil paleo-assemblages within each Neogene epoch. Specifically, we counted unique fossil observations within each hexagonal cell of resolution number 3 from Uber’s H3 geospatial indexing library (i.e. with an average spacing between adjacent cells of 103.6Km). This method was implemented with the bin_space() function of the paleoverse R package (v1.4.0). We filtered out those fossil paleo-assemblages containing less than three (3) Genera. This aggregation yielded 451 unique paleo-assemblages (Figure S2).\n\n3.2.1.3.1 Paleo-atmospheric temperature data\nWe utilized paleo-atmospheric temperature reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere (Hagen et al., 2019) as a proxy for macro-scale climatic variation across continental regions in space and Neogene across time. The dataset from Hagen et al. (2019) spans the Cenozoic (60 Ma to the present), and we extracted a subset corresponding to the temporal range of our fossil data. We aligned the spatial resolution of the climate data with that of our fossil paleo-assemblages by calculating simple means within each hexagonal grid cell. We created a raster stack for the Neogene (23–2 Ma) where each layer represented 1Ma (Figure S3).\n\n\n\n3.2.1.4 Defining climate change variables\n\n3.2.1.4.1 Calculating climate change magnitude and instability\nTo understand the environmental context in which fossil communities evolved, we summarized atmospheric temperature climate change across the Neogene within continental regions, separating long-term warming or cooling between epochs from short-term temperature variability within epochs.\nFirst, we estimated the magnitude of climate change between consecutive Neogene epochs  by extracting the raster values from each corresponding layer of the paleo-atmospheric temperature raster stack into a matrix form, with rows representing spatial grid cells and columns representing individual time points (Figure 2B). We conducted a linear regression for each grid cell individually, regressing temperature values against time for a given Neogene epoch. The coefficient extracted from each regression represents the magnitude of temperature change (slope). Positive slope values indicate warming trends whereas negative slope values indicate cooling trends (Figure 2C).\nSecond, we quantified climate instability by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) of atmospheric temperature for each grid cell over each Neogene epoch. Specifically, we computed the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean temperature (adjusted to Kelvin by adding 273.15) for each hexagonal grid cell across each Neogene epoch (Figure 2D).\n\n\n3.2.1.4.2 Defining spatial & temporal climate change regions\nWe identified regions with similar patterns of climate change in space and time to enable climate-based regional fauna comparison within continents across the entire Neogene. We started with a multiband raster stack were each layer represented the mean atmospheric temperature of continental raster pixels for each Neogene epoch. Then, we reduced dimensionality with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture dominant spatiotemporal gradients of atmospheric temperature variation across the Neogene. Specifically, we used the rasterPCA() function from the RStoolbox package which perform PCA directly on raster objects by treating each pixel as an observation and each raster layer as a variable (Leutner et al., 2018). From this new multiband raster stack, we extracted the first three principal components (PC1–PC3) and rescaled them to a [0,1] range. The first 3 PCA axes summarized 98.9% of the variance present in the mean atmospheric temperature raster stack. The first component alone comprised 89.9% of the variance with the second and third components making up for the 6.3% and 2.7% respectively.  After, we clustered continental regions with similar temporal climatic dynamics with k-means across a range of cluster numbers (k = 3 to 7). The optimal number of clusters was selected by maximizing within-group dispersion, as evaluated by the Calinski-Harabasz criterion (Figure 2A; Figure S4).\n\n\n\n3.2.1.5 Inferring biodiversity assembly processes in deep time\n\n3.2.1.5.1 Building a paleo-assemblage community network\nTo large scale biogeographical patterns through deep time, we linked fossil paleo-assemblages in the Neogene based on the similarity of their fossil composition.  We represented this linkage as a bipartite network representing the presence (1) or absence (0) of each genus across all defined paleo-assemblages (i.e., unique combinations of hexagonal grid cells and Neogene epochs). We obtained the unipartite projection of these bipartite network by calculating the compositional dissimilarity between paleo assemblages. Specifically, we calculated Simpson dissimilarity between every paleo-assemblage pair with the beta.sim() component of the beta.pair() function in the betapart R package. Simpson turnover index emphasizes species turnover by accounting for differences in shared taxa without being influenced by nestedness effects, making it well-suited for detecting true compositional replacement (Baselga et al., 2013) and provides a more reliable basis for tracking large-scale biogeographical patterns in the fossil record.  The resulting squared matrix of pairwise dissimilarities between paleo-assemblages served as the foundation for network construction (Figure S5).\n\n\n3.2.1.5.2 Delineating paleobiogeographic clusters in space and time\nWe used a stochastic block modelling (SBM) to delineate coherent paleobiogeographic regions across the Neogene. Stochastic block modelling (SBM) is a non-parametric statistical method that identifies groups within a network. The model inputs the paleo-assemblage dissimilarity matrix and outputs a) a vector of group labels assigning every paleoassemblage to a group (i.e. paleobiogeographic cluster), and b) connectivity (omega) matrix summarizing the degree of compositional dissimilarity within and between paleobiogeographic clusters (Figure S7). The SBM summarized the fossil paleo assemblage dissimilarity matrix and converged in a set of 40 paleobiogeographic clusters each representing a group of spatiotemporally cohesive and ecologically similar fossil paleo-assemblages. These paleo-biogeographic regions each represented in average ~11 fossil paleo-assemblages, ranging from 2 to 22. Europe had 25 paleobiogeographic regions where while 15 belonged to North America. \nWe employed spectral clustering for SBM model initialization, which improves convergence and stability for large networks. Spatial and Temporal distance matrices were used to inform the SBM’s prior structure, enabling it to partition assemblages into groups that not only share ecological similarity but are also proximally located in space and/or time. Models were fitted across a range (0-60) of candidate cluster numbers (K), and the optimal number of groups was selected based on the Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL) criterion (Figure S6). This criterion balances model fit and parsimony, penalizing overly complex models while favoring those that capture robust structure. Spatial distances were computed as great-circle distances (in kilometers) between the paleocoordinates (rotated to their Neogene positions) of each assemblage using the earth.dist() function from the fossil R package (Vavrek et al, 2020). Temporal distances were calculated as absolute differences (in millions of years) between the midpoint ages assigned to each Neogene epoch or each paleo-assemblage (Figure S7).  \n\n\n3.2.1.5.3 Linking climate change to fossil paleobiogeographic region dissimilarity\nTo obtain an standardized measure of the overall compositional heterogeneity within a window of space and time (i.e. beta-diversity), we calculated the mean of the diagonal elements of the corresponding omega submatrix, considering only the subset of paleobiogeographic clusters assigned to a given climate change region and Neogene epoch combination. In total we obtained 80 standardized measurements. We kept the number of contributing fossil assemblages and the variability of these submatrix diagonal summaries for use as model weights. We also recorded among-region dissimilarity from the corresponding off-diagonal paleobiogeographic cluster entries, but we did not consider them for further analysis.\nWe used beta-regression modelling to estimate the relationship between our standardized beta-diversity metric to a) the absolute magnitude of climatic change, b) the direction of the temperature trend (i.e. change slope sign - cooling (-) vs warming (+) ), c) climatic stability, and d) continent affiliation. Climate change magnitude and climatic instability predictor variables were scaled for comparability, and regions with more sampling effort were given greater weight based on the number of individual fossil observations (Supplementary text S1). Overall, we fitted a set of four beta-regression models with progressive degrees of complexity. The baseline model (Null model) included only the main effects of climate‐change magnitude and instability. Geographic structure was introduced in (Continental Model) by allowing both effects to vary by continent. Model (Continental Climate Sensitivity Model) further accounted for compound instability (the magnitude × instability interaction) and relaxed the assumption of constant variance by modeling the precision (dispersion (ϕ) component) of the beta-regression model response as a function of both instability and continent. This allowed the model to reflect that turnover patterns may be more variable under unstable climates and may differ in consistency between Europe and North America. In addition, site-based weights were applied to correct for uneven sampling intensity across bins. The most complex model (Directional Climate Response Model) added warming–cooling asymmetry (magnitude × direction). This explicitly tested whether large magnitudes of climatic change had stronger biodiversity effects under warming versus cooling episodes. Continent interactions with all predictors allowed for geographic contrasts in these dynamics. Model comparisons were evaluated using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Finally, we regressed turnover predictions from the best-fit model against geological time age using a loess smoothed function to identify the trajectory of turnover across 1Ma time intervals.",

    "text": "3.3 Results\n\n3.3.1 The diversity of fossil paleoassemblages\nFor all fossil paleo assemblages, genus richness per cell averaged approximately 14, with values ranging from 4 to 68. Across all Neogene epochs, the Burdigalian and Serravallian epoch exhibited the highest mean fossil richness, each averaging 16 genera per cell. The Langhian followed with a mean of 15, while the Tortonian and Messinian epochs showed means of 14 and 13, respectively. The Aquitanian and Piacenzian epoch recorded slightly lower averages, with 11 and 12 genera per cell. The Zanclean epoch had the lowest mean richness at 10 genera per cell. Minimum richness was consistent across all intervals at 4 genera per cell, while maximum values varied from 27 in the Zanclean to 68 in the Tortonian.\n\n\n3.3.2 Climate change across spatiotemporal climatic zones\nAcross climatic zones, temperature change and instability varied markedly within and between continents (Figure 3). In North America, climatic slopes showed a wider range, with higher median values in zones 2 and 4 (up to ~0.25 °C Ma⁻¹) and greater dispersion compared to other zones, indicating more pronounced directional shifts. Europe, in contrast, displayed generally lower and more consistent slopes across all zones (~0.10–0.15 °C Ma⁻¹). Patterns of climatic instability followed a similar structure: in North America, variability was higher overall, while Europe showed lower median instability and narrower ranges across zones. (Figure 3).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Spatiotemporal climatic zones and their temporal dynamics in North America and Europe during the Neogene (23–2 Ma). Climatic zones were identified as PCA-based clusters of contiguous regions with similar temporal trajectories of mean atmospheric temperature dynamics. (A) Geographic distribution of the five zones, color-coded from brown (Zone 1) to green (Zone 5). (B) Absolute temperature values (°C) averaged per zone and plotted across Neogene epochs. (C) Zone-specific trajectories of temperature change magnitude and plotted across Neogene epochs. (D) Climatic instability (relative variability of temperature) and plotted across epochs. For line plots, colored curves correspond to climatic zones, with epoch along the x-axis (yellow bar). Vertical dashed lines indicate the approximate peak of the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO).\n\n\nFive (5) climate change clusters best represented the spatial patterns of climate change dynamics contained in the paleoclimatic PCA. (Figure 2). The first climate change cluster span western Europe and low-latitude North America, where atmospheric temperature remained stable with minimal variability. The second climate change cluster was in northern Africa, California, and south of Florida, and showed a pattern of early warming followed by cooling, with increasing variability in Europe after 10 Ma. The third climate change cluster covered Russia, the Alps, and northeastern North America. This one displayed strong directional change, mid-Miocene cooling followed by European warming. The fourth climate change cluster, found in central North America, eastern Europe, and the steppes, was the most variable, with a major warming spike in the late Miocene to early Pliocene. Finally, the fifth climate change cluster, in northwestern North America, cooled early and later stabilized, with a milder warming–cooling cycle in Europe.\n\n\n3.3.3 Inferring biodiversity assembly processes in deep time\nFossil assemblages within a paleobiogeographic cluster shared on average about 40 % of their genera with other paleobiogeographic clusters in the same Neogene epoch. In North America, turnover was more heterogeneous across climate change clusters relative to Europe. We found strong evidence supporting the directional change hypothesis (H2), with opposite responses to warming and cooling between continents. In North America, rapid warming of about +0.25 °C Ma⁻¹ increased turnover by roughly 7%, whereas in Europe, equivalent warming reduced turnover by around 10%, indicating divergent biogeographic responses to directional climate forcing. We also found partial support for the oscillatory climate hypothesis (H3): climatic instability, approximately 0.1% higher relative temperature variability, slightly reduced turnover in Europe but increased it by up to 5% in North America. However, these effects weakened once climatic direction was modeled separately, suggesting that instability alone does not drive faunal reorganization. Finally, we found little evidence for the compound instability hypothesis (H4); instead, extremes of high magnitude and strong instability buffered turnover (Figure 4).\nThe Compound Instability Model and the Directional Climate Response Model consistently show that Neogene faunal turnover was shaped by the combined effects of long-term temperature trends and short-term climatic instability, with outcomes differing between continents. In North America, positive directional trends of about +0.25 °C per Ma or more unstable climates (≈ 0.11% higher relative temperature variability) each raised turnover by roughly 4–5%, reducing the proportion of genera shared among fossil assemblages. In Europe, turnover was overall higher but less sensitive to climatic fluctuations. Stronger temperature trends or instability slightly decreased turnover (by about 1–2%). When the direction of temperature change was explicitly included, the Directional Climate Response Model revealed that warming periods reduced turnover in Europe by roughly 10%, while increased it in North America by about 7%. High absolute temperature changes combined with strong instability produced a net buffering effect (≈ −11%).\nOverall model performance improved markedly from R² ≈ 0.08 (Compound Instability Model) to R² ≈ 0.42 (Directional Climate Response Model) (Table 1). When examining the results of the best fit model across time, In North America, during the Aquitanian–Burdigalian, turnover remained moderate (~0.62–0.64) under relatively stable climatic conditions. Across the Langhian–Serravallian, turnover peaked (~0.68–0.70) as the dashed line indicates a shift toward stronger warming trends (up to +0.25 °C Ma⁻¹) and higher climatic instability (~0.002–0.0025). Through the Tortonian, turnover declined sharply (~0.60), while both warming and instability subsided. A second, smaller rise in turnover occurred during the Messinian, preceding a strong cooling phase (~ –0.4 °C Ma⁻¹) and reduced instability (~0.001), after which turnover fell to its lowest levels in the Zanclean–Piacenzian (~0.57), marking a period of climatic stabilization toward the Pliocene. In Europe, turnover remained comparatively stable (~0.60–0.65) across epochs but exhibited a gradual, low-amplitude rise after the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO). During the Aquitanian–Burdigalian, both turnover and climatic variables were low and steady, with slopes near 0 °C Ma⁻¹ and instability with an SD close to 0.1% of its mean. Through the Langhian–Serravallian, turnover modestly increased (~0.62–0.64) as the dashed line shows mild cooling (–0.1 to –0.2 °C Ma⁻¹). The Tortonian–Messinian interval marked a slight rebound in temperature trends toward neutral to weak warming (~+0.15 °C Ma⁻¹) and minimal instability variation. By the Pliocene, turnover rose to its highest levels (~0.65) under moderate warming (~+0.2 °C Ma⁻¹) and low climatic variability with SD (~0.1% – 0.15%) of their means (Figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Predicted compositional turnover through time in North America (left panels) and Europe (right panels) during the Neogene. Points show estimated turnover values at 1 Ma intervals, with red shading indicating turnover and blue shading showing climate predictors. Top panels: turnover compared with the magnitude of climate change (°C per Ma).

    "text": "This thesis shows that ecological structure is not a single property that changes in parallel with species composition, but a multidimensional outcome constrained by processes operating across scales. Biodiversity change is often described in terms of species gains, losses, and turnover, yet these compositional changes only partially capture how ecosystems reorganize. Across contemporary multitrophic networks and deep-time fossil assemblages, this work demonstrates that ecological structure can be conserved despite substantial species turnover, or rapidly reorganized following relatively small compositional changes. These patterns arise because ecological structure is shaped by multiple layers of constraints that determine which traits, interactions, and organizational forms are possible.\nA central contribution of this thesis is to clarify how different processes constrain different dimensions of ecological structure. Evolutionary processes constrain the availability of traits and functional roles through speciation, extinction, and adaptation. Regional climatic and biogeographic processes constrain which subsets of this trait space can persist locally. Local demographic and community assembly processes further constrain which species can co-occur, persist, and dominate under given environmental conditions. Finally, interaction assembly processes constrain which species interact and how those interactions are organized into networks. These layers do not act independently: constraints imposed at one level shape the expression of constraints at other levels, and feedbacks across levels can amplify, dampen, or redirect ecological reorganization.\nBy applying this layered perspective across space and time, the thesis shows that environmental change alters which constraints matter most, rather than producing uniform ecological responses. In contemporary multitrophic systems, climatic gradients reshuffle the relative strength of bottom-up and top-down constraints, generating predictable changes in trait distributions and interaction structure without necessarily altering species richness. In deep time, similar climatic drivers produced contrasting outcomes across continents because they interacted with different evolutionary histories, regional species pools, and prior assembly trajectories. These results demonstrate that ecological structure is contingent on historical and biogeographic context, and that environmental forcing alone cannot explain patterns of biodiversity reorganization.\nTogether, these findings advance ecology by reframing biodiversity change as a problem of constrained emergence. Ecological structure emerges from the intersection of multiple assembly processes, each restricting the space of possible community configurations. Understanding biodiversity change therefore requires identifying how constraints shift, interact, and propagate across scales, rather than focusing solely on changes in species composition or network patterns. By integrating traits, interactions, networks, and deep-time dynamics within a single process-based framework, this thesis provides a coherent approach for studying how ecological systems are assembled, maintained, and reorganized. This perspective offers a stronger foundation for predicting ecosystem responses to ongoing global change, particularly in a world where environmental conditions are shifting faster than the processes that generate ecological structure can equilibrate.",

    "text": "A.1.1 Step 1: Defining the species pools\nWe simulated regional species pools separately for resource and consumer trophic levels. Each pool consisted of \\(5{,}000\\) individuals, distributed uniformly among \\(500\\) species. As such, the relative abundance for all species was \\(1/500\\). Each consumer species, \\(c\\), and each resource species, \\(r\\), was assigned a trait mean (\\(t_c\\) and \\(t_r\\), respectively) from a uniform distribution ranging from \\(0\\) to \\(1\\). Each consumer individual, \\(i\\), was assigned a trait value of \\(t_{ci}\\), drawn from a normal distribution around \\(t_c\\) (\\(\\sigma = 0.001\\)). Each resource individual, \\(j\\), was assigned a trait value of \\(t_{rj}\\), drawn from a normal distribution around \\(t_r\\) (\\(\\sigma = 0.001\\)). We considered one-dimensional trait distributions in this simulation in order to represent the combined effects of several response traits from \\(n\\)-dimensional hypervolumes (Blonder et al. 2014).\n\n\nA.1.2 Step 2: Creating local communities\nWe used a coalescent-based algorithm (Munoz et al. 2018) to assemble local consumer and resource communities individuals from the regional species pool. Each local community numbered 500 individuals. Under this algorithm, the occurrence and abundance of a species in a local community depends on the successful immigration of ancestor individuals from the species pool and subsequent survival of descendant individuals. The algorithm is governed by a migratory rate parameter, m, that ranges from 0 to 1 (Hubbell 2001, Munoz et al. 2018) where higher values of m increase the effect of offspring on the final composition of local communities. That is, the simulation of the local communities has an element of temporal evolution determined by the migratory rate parameter. However, when building the resource-consumer networks in the later steps, we only consider the resulting local communities, not the genealogy leading to them. The coalescent-based assembly algorithm is part of the ecolottery package (Munoz et al. 2018) for the R software (version 3.5.3; R Core Team 2019). To explore variation in network structure under various ecological conditions, we varied the simulation parameters to represent variation in community and interaction assembly processes. We simulated a total of 108 unique bipartite network assembly scenarios. Seventyeight assembly scenarios had the same community assembly process at both trophic levels and 30 assembly scenarios had a trait-based community assembly process at one and a stochastic community assembly process at the other trophic level (Table S1). To vary the community assembly process, we modified the function governing the probability of an individual successfully immigrating from the species pool to the local assemblage (pci for consumer individuals and prj for resource individuals) to simulate the stochastic assembly and/or trait-based assembly at each trophic level.\n\n\nA.1.3 Step 2.1: Simulating community assembly processes\n\nA.1.3.1 Step 2.1.1: Stochastic community assembly\nWe simulated two processes of stochastic assembly, namely ecological drift (Vellend 2010) and demographic stochasticity (Hubbell 2001). We simulated ecological drift by choosing a uniform immigration probability distribution that was independent of individuals’ trait values. Specifically, all individuals had an equal probability, \\(p_{ci} = p_{rj} = 0.1\\), of being sampled from the regional species pool. Replacement probabilities of simulated mortality events during community formation were accounted for to simulate the effects of ecological drift and demographic stochasticity (Etienne and Olff 2004). After a simulated mortality event during community coalescence, individuals can be replaced with the offspring of the remaining individuals in the local community \\((J - 1)\\) or with a new immigrant individual from the species pool with probability \\((1 - m)\\). The competition of local offspring and immigrants to replace dead individuals in the community is commonly referred to as the immigration parameter \\(I\\). The immigration parameter \\(I\\) depends on both \\(m\\) (migratory rate parameter) and \\(J\\) (number of individuals in the community), such that \\(I = m(J - 1)/(1 - m)\\) (Etienne and Olff 2004). In our simulations, we set \\(m = 0.5\\) to reduce the effect of genealogy on the local community and thus mimic conditions where local communities are formed mainly by the initial migrant individuals. In addition, no trait-based constraints were imposed on the immigration probabilities of individuals from the species pool to the community (Munoz et al. 2018). Further work can explore changes in the immigration parameter in order to parameterize models of network assembly along the genealogy of communities (Etienne and Olff 2004; Etienne 2009; Munoz et al. 2018).\n\n\nA.1.3.2 Step 2.1.2: Environmental filtering\nWe simulated trait-based processes as trait-dependent individual based immigration probabilities from the regional pool. Specifically, to simulate environmental filtering, we assigned probabilities of successful immigration of individuals from a normal distribution around an arbitrarily centered trait optimum, \\(t_{opt}\\) = 0.2, with a standard deviation of \\(σ_{opt}\\) . (Figure 2 in the main text; Munoz et al. 2018). That is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 1\n\n\n\n\\[p_{ij} = e^{-\\frac{\\left(t_{c i}-t_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\right)^2}{\\left(2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{opt}}\\right)^2}}\n\\]\n\n\nWe modulated the intensity of environmental filtering by varying \\(σ_{opt}\\), where more intense filtering was simulated by a narrower distribution. We used five different values of σopt, from weak \\(σ_{opt}\\) to strong ( \\(σ_{opt}\\) = 0.1), to simulate a gradient of filtering intensities, i.e. process strengths.\nWe simulated distinct (im)balances of deterministic resource and consumer assembly processes by independently varying the intensities of trait-based community assembly at consumer (σoptc) and resource trophic levels (σoptr). We computed process strength asymmetry (PSA) calculated as the natural logarithm of the ratio of consumer and resource process strengths (Equation S2). We considered process strengths to be asymmetrical when PSA ≠ 0. Symmetry of process strengths between trophic levels occurs at all same magnitude combinations of σoptc and σoptr, which renders PSA = 0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 2\n\n\n\n\\[PSA = log_e(σ_{opt_c} / σ_{opt_r})\\]\n\n\n\n\nA.1.3.3 Step 2.2 Simulating interaction assembly processes\nAfter generating the local resource and consumer communities, we simulated interaction assembly processes between the two trophic levels. We calculated the probability, pc,r, of interaction between for resource and consumer species modelled at the species individual level for distinct interaction assembly process types ranging from stochastic (density-dependent) to deterministic (trait-based).\n\n\nA.1.3.4 Step 2.2.1 Stochastic interaction assembly\nWe modelled stochastic interaction assembly as purely density dependent probabilities. This ecologically emulates random encounter probabilities between individuals of the species in the community, assuming a well-mixed system. As a consequence, \\(p\\), is independent from the species’ trait values. The probability that consumer species \\(c\\) and resource species \\(r\\) interact is only driven by the change in their relative abundances, such that the interactions that occur most frequently are those between the most abundant species (Morales-Castilla et al. 2015, Chacoff et al. 2018) (Equation S3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 3\n\n\n\n\\[p = A_c\\times A_r\\]\nwhere \\(A_c\\) is the abundance of consumer species \\(c\\) relative to total local consumer abundance, and \\(A_r\\)is the abundance of resource species \\(r\\) relative to the total local resource abundance.\n\n\n\n\nA.1.3.5 Step 2.2.2 Functional trait matching\nTo simulate trait-based interaction processes between trophic levels, pairwise interaction probabilities, pc,r, were dependent on the species individuals’ trait values. We modelled pairwise interaction probabilities by simulating two distinct types of functional trait matching: forbidden links and morphological matching. Forbidden links is a type of deterministic interaction assembly process whereby interaction partners are constrained to species within a certain range of traits (Morales-Castilla et al. 2015). Within this constrained set of potential partners, species’ relative abundances define pairwise interaction probabilities. This mimics interactions that occur in nature as if, for example, resource selection is gape-limited (e.g., small-beaked birds cannot eat large fruits, but largebeaked birds can eat fruits of all sizes). Thus, we simulated interaction assembly governed by forbidden links as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 4\n\n\n\nif \\[t_c \\leq t_r \\rightarrow p_{c,r} = 0\\]\nif \\[t_c &gt; t_r \\rightarrow p_{c,r} = A\\]\n\n\nMorphological matching is another type of deterministic interaction assembly process. Here, pairwise interactions occur only whenever there is a strong trait match between the values of functional traits of species individuals (Maglianesi et al. 2014, Sazatornil et al. 2016). In our simulations under morphological matching, the effect of the trait-based interaction assembly modifies the probability of abundance driven interactions between species. In nature, morphological matching arises due to the evolution of functional specialization between6 interacting species pairs (e.g., insect proboscis length - corolla length; Sazatornil et al. 2016) or represents cases where optimal foraging governs the ecological interactions between species (Maglianesi et al. 2014, Sazatornil et al. 2016). Our definition of morphological matching reflects the definitions presented by preceding literature (e.g., Maglianesi et al. 2014) such that we considered the strength of trait matching to be fixed instead of varying the trait matching strength. That is, we did not consider scenarios of adaptive foraging or the context dependency of pairwise interactions. Such processes could be introduced in the simulations by regulating trait matching strength with a sigma parameter similarly to environmental filtering simulations (section S2.1.2). Thus, we simulated interaction probabilities to depend on the difference in trait values between consumer and resource species as well as on the relative abundances within trophic levels (A).\nThat is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 5\n\n\n\n\\[p = A(1-|t_c-t_r|)\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.4 Step 3: Assembling resource-consumer networks\nAs a result of our simulations, we obtained a set of probabilistic interaction networks at the species level. We collapse these initial probabilistic networks into binary networks by considering as realized interactions (\\(p = 1\\)) those interactions whose pairwise interaction probability falls above the fourth-largest quantile of the whole probability distribution, and by assigning interactions under that threshold a value of \\(p = 0\\). Species that were present in the probabilistic network but not linked to any species after the threshold were not considered part of the “observed” interaction network. We recognize that thresholding probabilistic networks may lead to an under-representation of rare interaction events (see Poisot et al. 2015), but we expect those effects to be minimal and unlikely to change the larger patterns of network structure under distinct assembly process types.\n\n\nA.1.5 Step 4: Quantifying resource-consumer network structure\nWe selected two widely used metrics of network structure for binary bipartite networks: modularity and nestedness. Modularity is a measure of the degree to which a network is divided into modules. Modules are clusters of network nodes (species) with many links amongst themselves and few links to nodes in other modules. In highly modular networks, there are7 cohesive sub-clusters of species interacting more with each other than with other species present in the network (Olesen et al. 2007). We quantified the modularity of our simulated networks using the Q metric (Barber 2007). This metric is calculated using a label-propagation algorithm (Liu and Murata 2010, Beckett 2015) which maximizes Barber’s modularity (Barber 2007). Nestedness is a measure of the degree to which nodes with few links share a subset of the links of nodes with many links. In perfectly nested networks, interaction partners of specialists are subsets of the interaction partners of generalists (Bascompte et al. 2003). In the case of consumer-resource networks, it is a measure of the degree to which specialists consume a subset of the resources consumed by generalists. We quantified the nestedness of our simulated networks using the NODF metric (Almeida-Neto et al. 2008). The functions to calculate modularity and nestedness were implemented from the bipartite package for R (Dormann et al. 2009).\nModularity (\\(Q\\)) and nestedness (\\(NODF\\)) values are dependent on intrinsic network properties, such as network size and connectance (Fortuna et al. 2010; Beckett 2015; Simmons et al. 2018; Song et al. 2019). We expected the effect of network size on network metric variation to be minimal because we simulated our networks to vary little in their species richness and connectance. However, to minimize any issues related to network size and to ensure that our network structure metrics are comparable across simulation scenarios, we standardized modularity and nestedness using Z-scores for the network structural indices. We did this by subtracting the observed metric values from the expected mean values of a null distribution and dividing by the standard deviation of that null distribution. We selected two swapping algorithms to generate this null distribution of expected network metric values from \\(100\\) independent network rewires. We used two different rewiring models that keep network size and row and column totals constant. The first, the DegreeProbable–DegreeProbable model, shuffles individual elements \\(d_{i,kj}\\) of the pairwise interaction matrix based on the probability \\(p_{ij}\\) that corresponds to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 6\n\n\n\n\n\\[p_{ij} = 0.5 \\times (d_j/rows + k_i /cols)\\]\nwhere \\(d_j\\) is the degree of column \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) is the degree of row \\(i\\). \\(rows\\) and \\(cols\\) are the total number of rows and columns respectively (Bascompte et al. 2003, Beckett 2015, Mariani et al. 2019).\n\n\nAdditionally, to ensure that the choice of rewiring method does not influence the estimated network metric values, we separately used the “curveball” rewiring algorithm (Strona et al. 2014) to calculate network metric Z-scores. This algorithm also maintains row and column sum totals constant but swaps elements in a stepwise manner. First, the algorithm lists all the column elements occurring on each row. Second, it “trades” the non-occurring elements between two of the random of the previously created lists and reiterates this process a number of times. Finally, it reconstructs a presence-absence matrix from the reshuffled list (Strona et al. 2014). We found that the two rewiring methods produced parallel results and do not present the results of the “curveball” method here.\nTo test for the effects of connectance on network metric variance, we calculated the correlation of modularity \\(Q\\) Z-scores and nestedness \\(NODF\\) Z-scores with connectance for all simulated networks using Spearman rank correlations. Our thresholding approach produced similarly sized networks with typical levels of connectance in natural resource–consumer networks (\\(0.2\\)–\\(0.4\\); Valdovinos et al. 2016). Networks assembled under stochastic interaction and forbidden-links assembly had similar connectance levels (NL: mean \\(= 0.29\\), sd \\(= 0.03\\); FL: mean \\(= 0.28\\), sd \\(= 0.04\\)) that were higher than those for networks assembled with morphological matching (MM: mean \\(= 0.22\\), sd \\(= 0.04\\)). We expected slightly lower connectance levels for morphological matching networks, since morphological trait matching increases the overall level of specialization of pairwise interactions. We found weak correlations between connectance and nestedness \\(NODF\\) Z-scores (\\(\\rho = 0.32\\), \\(p = 0.004\\)) and between connectance and modularity \\(Q\\) Z-scores (\\(\\rho = -0.17\\), \\(p = 0.11\\)) across the simulated networks. We used binary modularity and nestedness because they represent contrasting properties of network structure and are commonly used to summarize the dynamics of ecological networks, such as robustness and stability (Staniczenko et al. 2013; Grilli et al. 2016; Guzman et al. 2020). However, our framework can equally be applied to other measures of network structure, including quantitative metrics (e.g., network-level specialization, \\(H_2'\\); Blüthgen et al. 2008; spectral radius \\(\\rho(\\cdot)\\); Staniczenko et al. 2013).\n\n\nA.1.6 Step 5: Quantifying the effects of trait-based assembly processes on network structure\nTo quantify the effect of trait-based assembly processes on network structure, we first defined a two-dimensional space of modularity (\\(Q\\) Z-score on the \\(x\\)-axis) and nestedness (\\(NODF\\) Z-score on the \\(y\\)-axis) (Figure 3 in the main text). Mean modularity and nestedness across simulation replicates of all simulated networks were mapped in this network-structure space. Thus, the standardized mean differences among networks represented their overall structural differences. We quantified the effect of trait-based interaction assembly as the pairwise distances between networks that share the same community assembly process but differ in their trait-based interaction assembly. Specifically, we calculated the standardized mean differences between networks assembled under forbidden links and morphological matching relative to the corresponding networks assembled under stochastic interaction assembly. Within each trait-based interaction assembly type (i.e., clusters of symbols in Figure 3 in the main text), we quantified the effect of trait-based community assembly as the standardized mean differences between networks assembled under environmental filtering and networks assembled under stochastic community assembly (i.e., standardized distances of symbols relative to the cluster cross in Figure 3 of the main text).\n\n\nA.1.7 Step 6: Quantifying the drivers of variation in bipartite network structure\nUsing multiple regression, we first modelled the relationship between each stochastic or trait-based community and interaction assembly process and network structure for those 78 network scenarios with the same community assembly process at both trophic levels. We did this separately for modularity (\\(Q\\) Z-score mean) and nestedness (\\(NODF\\) Z-score mean) and for each interaction assembly type, totaling six different linear models. For each of these linear models, we used commonality analysis (Nimon et al. 2008; Ray-Mukherjee et al. 2014) to decompose the explained variance (\\(R^2\\)) in network structure metrics and effects on network structure into components of independent variation attributable to explanatory variables. We carried out this variance partitioning for simulated networks with the same community assembly process at both trophic levels (1) across all scenarios and (2) separately for subsets based on interaction assembly process type. We used these subsets to remove the effect of interaction assembly process on network structure, because the large relative effect of the type of interaction assembly (neutral, morphological matching, forbidden links) absorbed most of the variation and did not allow showing the remaining effect that process strength asymmetry had on network structure (Appendix S2: Figures S1 and S2, Table S1). We used regression commonality analysis because it allows obtaining both the unique and shared effects of entangled community and interaction assembly processes on network structure. This property of the analysis is highly relevant in the context of our conceptual framework, as the effects of community and interaction assembly processes on network structure are likely entangled. Multiple regressions and commonality coefficients were obtained using the packages stats (R Core Team 2019) and yhat (Nimon et al. 2008) for the R environment (version 3.6.3; R Core Team 2019).\nNext, to understand how process strength asymmetry influences network structure within a given interaction assembly type, we used GLMs with modularity (\\(Q\\) Z-scores) and nestedness (\\(NODF\\) Z-scores) as response variables. In these models, process strength asymmetry (\\(PSA\\)), interaction assembly type, and their interaction were included as predictor variables. As a next step, we sought to separate the effect of process strength asymmetry on network structure from the total effect of deterministic community assembly processes on networks. To this end, we computed standardized differences in modularity and nestedness between networks assembled under asymmetrical resource and consumer assembly process strengths (i.e., \\(PSA \\neq 0\\)) and networks assembled under symmetrical resource and consumer assembly process strengths (i.e., \\(PSA = 0\\)).\nFinally, we explored the interplay of process strength asymmetry and network assembly mode determining network structure. More specifically, to test for bottom-up and top-down assembly effects on network structure, we excluded either the effect of deterministic (trait-based) resource or consumer community assembly by “switching off” deterministic and “switching on” stochastic community assembly processes. We then compared the structure of the networks where both trophic levels were assembled under the same community assembly process to the networks where the two trophic levels were assembled under contrasting community assembly processes (i.e., with stochastic assembly at one and deterministic assembly at the other trophic level) (Table S1). Thereby, we obtained the effect of network assembly mode on network structure across a gradient of process strength asymmetries. To better understand the interactions11 of community and interaction assembly processes, we compared the relationships between assembly mode and the effects of process strength asymmetry on network structure among interaction assembly types.\n\n\nA.1.8 Step 7: Quantifying network assembly mode (bottom-up and top-down) effects on network structure\nWe compared the network metrics of the networks assembled under environmental filtering process at both trophic levels to the network metrics of the corresponding networks assembled with environmental filtering process at one trophic level and stochastic process at the other trophic level. We did this to quantify the bottom-up and top-down effects on network structure. The bottom-up effects were inferred by comparing networks with environmental filtering process at both trophic levels to networks with environmental filtering process at consumer trophic level and stochastic process at resource trophic level. The top-down effects were inferred by comparing networks with environmental filtering process at both trophic levels to networks with environmental filtering process at resource trophic level and stochastic process at consumer trophic level. We calculated effect sizes (SESNET) that corresponded to the standardized mean differences between the compared network metrics (Equation S7.1, S7.2). Finally, we computed network assembly mode as the log-ratio of SESNET between the two trophic levels. That is, the assembly mode was top-down if the log-ratio was positive and bottom-up if the log-ratio was negative (Equation 7.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 7.1\n\n\n\n\\[\nSES_{net} = (mean_{EF}- mean{EF_{nl/ef}})/SD_{pooled}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 7.2\n\n\n\n\\[SE_{pooled} = \\sqrt{(sd_{EF})^2 + (sd_{NL/EF})^2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 7.3\n\n\n\n\\[\nlog(SES_{net_{c}}/SES_{net_{r}})\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable S1. Scenarios simulating stochastic and trait-based network assembly.\n\n\n\nStochastic scenarios were simulated under stochastic community assembly (i.e., stochastically assembled resource and consumer communities). Trait-based scenarios were simulated under environmental filtering of different filtering intensities (σ) at resource and consumer trophic levels. Mixed scenarios were simulated with stochastic community assembly at one trophic level and traitbased community assembly at the other trophic level. Pairwise interactions were assembled under different types of functional trait matching or under stochastic interaction assembly (i.e., morphological matching, forbidden links, and stochastically assembled interactions). Each scenario was replicated 100 independent times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.9 Additional simulation results\nDoes spatial variation in the relative strengths of community and interaction assembly processes lead to predictable variation in network structures?\nBoth community and interaction assembly processes significantly influenced the structure of resource-consumer networks (Figure S1A). However, we found that the type of interaction assembly process had the strongest effect on network structure. The effects of trait-based interaction assembly, namely morphological matching and forbidden links, on network structure were equally strong and both deviated from the effects of stochastic interaction assembly (compare delineated clusters in Figure S1A). Both morphological matching and forbidden links resulted in more nested and less modular networks, whereas the opposite was the case for stochastic interaction assembly. When we quantified the effects of community and interaction assembly separately using commonality analysis, we found that changes in the type of interaction assembly process explained 70% and 81% of the total variation in modularity and nestedness, respectively. In contrast, changes in the type of community assembly process explained only 0.2% of the total variation in both modularity and nestedness. Similarly, variation in process strength asymmetry (PSA), explained only 2% and 0.1% of the total variation in modularity and nestedness, respectively. However,2 when we repeated this variance partitioning for subsets of networks under the same interaction assembly type (e.g., forbidden links), 36-64% of the variance in network structure was explained by PSA (Figure S1, Table S1).\nHow does the relative influence of bottom-up and top-down assembly modes on network structure vary along environmental gradients?\nAsymmetry in the relative strength of community assembly processes between the resource and consumer trophic levels (PSA) induced variation in network structures (distribution of points along x-axes in Figure S1B-C). The extent of such variation was larger for network modularity, while the variation was more clearly attributed to interaction assembly type for nestedness (Figure S1B-C). Moreover, the simulated networks varied along the assembly mode gradient (distribution of points along y-axes in Figure S1B-C). For example, networks assembled under forbidden links tended to have a bottom-up assembly mode in terms of network modularity. When considering the variation along PSA and network assembly mode gradients simultaneously, the GLM model showed a significant interaction between the effect of PSA and that of interaction assembly type on modularity and only when pairwise interactions were assembled under forbidden links (Figure S1B-C, Table S1). Process strength asymmetry and network assembly mode had contrasting influences on network structure (Spearman correlation between PSA and assembly mode: r nestedness = -0.02, r modularity = -0.14; calculated for points in Figure S1B-C). Given the negative correlations between\nPSA and assembly mode effects on network structure, the mode of network assembly can dampen the overall effect of process strength asymmetry on network structure, particularly for network modularity. We note that we did not pre-determine the assembly mode in the simulations. Rather, we set different strengths of community assembly to resource and consumer trophic levels that can lead to varying assembly modes in the networks. Moreover, given that we quantify the assembly mode relative to a scenario where the community assembly strengths do not differ between trophic levels, the assembly mode in our simulations represents the distances between symmetric and asymmetric community assembly process simulation scenarios in our structural space (defined by modularity and nestedness).3\n\n\n\nFigure S1. Community and interaction assembly processes define the structure of simulated resource-consumer networks. Panel A shows the simulated networks in a two-dimensional network structure space of modularity and nestedness. Convex hulls delineate the limits and variance of network structures for each simulated interaction assembly type. The color of the lines, symbols and bars across the panels indicate the interaction assembly type. Each symbol corresponds to the mean network structure metric value of 10 independent network replicates with deterministic resource and consumer community assembly processes. The effect of deterministic community assembly (here, stabilizing environmental filtering) on network structure is illustrated as the deviation of the colored symbol from the correspondingly colored cross. Cross axis lengths indicate the standard deviation in modularity (horizontal cross axis) and nestedness (vertical cross axis) under stochastic community assembly at both trophic levels. The further a symbol is from the cross, the stronger the effect of environmental filtering on network structure. The convex hull areas represent the magnitude of the effect that deterministic community assembly processes have on network structure when interaction assembly type is constant. Deterministic community assembly within each interaction assembly type varies in process strength asymmetry between trophic levels (PSA; log-ratio between the strengths of deterministic resource and consumer assembly processes). Panels B and C illustrate the relationships between the network assembly mode (y-axis) and PSA effect on network structure (x-axis). Positive and negative network assembly values indicate that the network is predominantly assembled under deterministic top-down and bottom-up assembly processes, respectively. If the relative magnitudes of bottom-up and top-down assembly modes are equivalent, the assembly mode = 0. The effect of PSA on network structure is quantified as the4 standardized mean deviation of the network structure metric from the expected mean network structure metric of the set of networks assembled under symmetrical process strengths. For additional details on the simulation methods, see Appendix S1.\n\n\n\n\nA.1.10 Additional simulation discussion\nOur simulations reveal that in general, interaction assembly matters more than community assembly in shaping networks. Perhaps the most exciting result is that when functional trait matching is the main driver of network assembly, process strength asymmetry dictates the predominance of bottom-up or top-down effects, which is consistent with previous empirical work (Albrecht et al. 2018). In natural networks, process strength asymmetry may be the result of differences in how trophic levels respond to abiotic and biotic drivers (e.g., along climatic gradients; Van Der Plas et al. 2012). Because abiotic and biotic drivers vary spatially, the strength of bottom-up and top-down effects is likely to do so as well (Gripenberg and Roslin 2007). Our simulations show how this variation in the assembly mode can modify network structure through an assembly cascade that emerges from the interdependence of community and interaction assembly processes. That is, assembly processes shaping the composition of one trophic level indirectly govern the assembly of another trophic level, but the magnitude of this cascade depends on the interaction assembly type. Earlier studies have reported somewhat analogous trophic cascades from apex predators to lower trophic levels via resource use (e.g., Ripple & Beschta 2012), but they have focused on single populations (i.e., single species) at each trophic level, rather than communities. Furthermore, they have not considered which and how particular processes within and between trophic levels mediate the observed cascade. Identifying and quantifying such processes is now possible with the help of our framework.5\n\n\n\nFigure S2.

This resulted in six study sites along an elevational gradient. Each study site included three plots, 30 meters x 100 meters in size. Seed removal interactions by frugivorous birds were recorded at all plant species bearing fleshy fruits in each plot. Sampling was conducted four times at each study site in 2014 and 2015, twice during the most humid months and twice during the least humid months. Interactions in each plot were observed on four consecutive days for 25 hours in total. Finally, observations were pooled by combining observations of all plots within each study site. The total observation effort for each study site was 300 hours.\nPlants were identified to species or morphospecies level and birds were identified to species level. In each plot, each fruiting plant was observed for a similar amount of time. An interaction was recorded when a bird individual consumed at least one fruit of the plant species. The number of visits between bird and plant species was recorded to build a quantitative network.Data for key functional traits were collected for both plants and frugivores. For plants, fruit length, fruit width, fruit mass and plant height were measured for individuals sampled from the study plots. For birds, bill length, bill width, body mass and hand-wing index were measured for museum specimens. These matching traits correspond between the trophic levels in terms of size, morphology, energy provisioning and requirements, and foraging behavior. For more details on data collection, see Quitián et al. (2018, 2019).\n\n\nA.2.2 Delineation of the regional species pool\nTo apply the null model approach to the case study data, we constructed a process-based regional species pool to sample plant and frugivore species from the pool to the local null communities (Figure S1). First, species pool delineation should be specific to a particular community (Lessard et al. 2012). Second, it should consider both the probability of species’ dispersal from the regional pool into the local community as well as the probability of species successful establishment, which is contingent on the species’ ability to tolerate environmental conditions following colonization. Ideally, data describing the geographic distribution, traits, and interactions of all resource and consumer species in a study region would ideally be employed to construct the most realistic species pools (Lessard et al. 2012, 2016), but we often lack the data needed to attain such complexity of species pools. As such, it’s often needed to make our best approximation using data available at the moment of analysis. To characterize the environmental variation we used slope and elevation data derived from a digital elevation model (SRTM shuttle; Farr et al. 2007) and the WorldClim database (version 1; Hijmans et al. 2005) to obtain mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation for each study site.\nIn our probabilistic species pool, we defined site-specific sampling probabilities as a function of geographical and environmental distances. We used geographical distances as proxies for the dispersal probabilities of species among sites. We computed geographical distances as least-cost path (LCP) distances penalized by layers of variables describing the topography of the terrain (slope), elevation, mean annual temperature (MAT), and mean annual precipitation (MAP). As proxies for the probabilities of successful establishment of species in a given site, we usedEuclidean distances in multivariate environmental space. We constructed this multivariate environmental space with and computed Euclidean distances between sites in the plane formed by the first two axes of a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) that synthesized the main gradients from slope, elevation, MAT, MAP. Finally, the probability matrix of study sites corresponded to the product of geographical and environmental distance matrices such that both matrices were assigned equal weights (0.5). Clustering analysis of this probability matrix revealed the presence of two clusters with high probability of species exchange within sites. As such, there was a separation of species pool for the high elevation containing the sites at 3000 m.a.s.l. and for the mid-low elevation containing the sites within the range of 1000 to 2000 m.a.s.l.\n\n\n\nFigure S3. A process-based procedure to delineate probabilistic species pools. In panel A, we show the environmental layers used to build the species pool are shown as maps. Points show the geographical location of the study sites. In panel B, we show our computed probabilities of dispersal and establishment. Dispersal probabilities are calculated as the inverse of the least-cost path distances between sites, penalized by the environmental variables. Establishment probabilities are the inverse of the Euclidean distances in multivariate environmental spaceobtained with PCA, representing the similarity of environmental niches among sites. In panel C, These dispersal and establishment probabilities among sites are combined together to form our probabilistic species pool. A matrix for the probabilistic selection of species when sampling from the regional pool to create local null communities.\n\n\n\n\nA.2.3 Applying the null model approach to the observational data\nWe scaled the multidimensional variance of traits between plant and frugivore trophic levels with an RLQ analysis in a metanetwork consisting of all species and interactions observed across all local networks (Dehling et al. 2014; Dray et al. 2014; Albrecht et al. 2018). Broadly speaking, the RLQ analysis is an ordination method that can be used to quantify the multivariate links between two matrices, \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\), via a third matrix \\(L\\) (Dolédec et al. 1996). We combined the RLQ ordination with a fourth-corner analysis, which integrates a permutation approach designed to test whether the associations between matrices \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\) via \\(L\\) are statistically different from a given null model (Dray et al. 2014). In our case, we adopted a combination of the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test for functional relationships between the multidimensional trait spaces of plants and frugivores in the mutualistic networks. More specifically, the RLQ analysis builds on the simultaneous ordination of three tables: a table \\(R\\) (\\(m \\times p\\)) describing \\(p\\) traits for \\(m\\) plant species, a table \\(Q\\) (\\(n \\times a\\)) describing \\(a\\) traits for \\(n\\) frugivore species, and a third table \\(L\\) (\\(m \\times n\\)) containing qualitative or quantitative information about the occurrence or frequency of pairwise interactions between the \\(m\\) plant and \\(n\\) frugivore species. We then applied the fourth-corner permutation test (model \\(6\\) with \\(9{,}999\\) permutations; ter Braak et al. 2012) to evaluate the statistical significance of the associations between plant and frugivore trait spaces. For further details, see Albrecht et al. (2018).\nWe tested for associations between plant and frugivore trait spaces at the regional level, where a significant association implies the presence of a trait-based interaction assembly process (Dehling et al. 2014, Dray et al. 2014, Albrecht et al. 2018). We used the scores of each plant and frugivore species along the first axis of this trait space as a one-dimensional summary of their trait space (Figure S2; Figure 4 in the main text). Note that due to data limitations, we used this one-dimensional summary of the trait space both as response and matching trait in the following steps.To detect the presence of environmental filtering in the plant and frugivore communities within each local network, we compared standard deviations of the RLQ trait values of the local communities to a distribution of standard deviations from 1000 null communities. To produce these null communities, we iteratively sampled one random species from the regional pool until the null community had the same species richness as the respective observed community using a probability-weighted resampling (see Lessard et al. 2012; Figure S1).\n\n\n\nFigure S4. Trait matching in a plant-frugivore regional meta-web aggregated from local networks sampled across an elevational gradient in the Ecuadorian Andes. Panel a) illustrates the multivariate RLQ shared trait space between frugivores and plants. Colored vectors in the two-dimensional trait space represent the scaled covariate coefficients of plant (blue) and frugivore (red) traits along the first two synthetic RLQ axes. Similar direction andmagnitude between vectors of distinct colors indicate the presence of trait-matching between trophic levels. Different types of traits relevant for interactions, energy provisioning for plants and requirements of frugivores, and stratum in plants and mobility in frugivores are illustrated with solid and dashed lines. The histogram of RLQ eigenvalues shows the percentage from total cross-covariance between plant and frugivore multidimensional trait spaces is explained by each of the RLQ axes. Panel B shows the aggregated plant-frugivore metaweb embedded in the multivariate trait space. Point coordinates in trait-space are in function of the plants (blue) and frugivores (red) scores in the 2 first RLQ axes, whereas grey lines between points denote pairwise interactions. Points area is a function of the relative number of interactions of individual species (i.e., generalist-specialist).\n\n\nWe quantified standardized effect sizes of plant and frugivore communities on the standard deviation of the respective trait distribution. We considered a smaller standard deviation than the null expectation to imply environmental filtering, whereas larger standard deviation from the null expectation signaled overdispersion. We then used the trophic level-specific effect sizes of community assembly processes to calculate process strength asymmetry as the log-ratio of community assembly process strengths between plant and frugivore trophic levels (Appendix S1, Equation S2).\nSecond, we inferred the effect of trait-based assembly processes on network structure. For each observed network, we generated four sets of null networks, each set with \\(100\\) replicates: \\(R_{\\mathrm{Obs}},C_{\\mathrm{Obs}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}\\), \\(R_{\\mathrm{Null}},C_{\\mathrm{Obs}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}\\), \\(R_{\\mathrm{Obs}},C_{\\mathrm{Null}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}\\), and \\(R_{\\mathrm{Null}},C_{\\mathrm{Null}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}\\). To produce these null networks, we simulated plant and frugivore communities with the same species and interaction richness as in the observed communities. For communities with simulated stochastic community assembly processes, we randomly sampled species by sampling individuals from the same cumulative distribution of the \\(1{,}000\\) plant or frugivore null communities that were used to test for environmental filtering. In other words, we simulated relative abundances based on immigration probabilities, such that species that are more likely to immigrate are also more abundant. For communities with simulated trait-based processes, we maintained the same observed plant or frugivore species composition with uniform relative abundances of species. In all four sets of null networks, we simulated stochastic interaction assembly processes; that is, we set the interaction probabilities as functions of local species’ abundances. We transformed our probabilistic networks into binary ones by sampling interactions based on the calculated pairwise interaction probabilities, such that each null network had the same total pairwise interaction richness as the respective observed network.\nAfter assembling the required null networks, we quantified the network structure of each observed and null network as modularity (Q Z-scores) and nestedness (NODF Z-scores) using the ‘bipartite’ package in R (Dormann et al. 2009). We compared modularity and nestedness values between observed and null networks and estimated the standardized effect sizes (SESNET) of the pairwise differences in network metrics.\nBy comparing the SESNET derived from each set of null networks, we inferred the relative effects of trait-based resource, consumer, and interaction assembly (Table 1b in the main text). The \\(R_{Obs},C_{Obs},I_{Null}\\) null network simulates only interaction assembly as a stochastic process; therefore, the SESNET of \\(R_{Obs},C_{\\mathrm{Obs}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}\\) represents the effect of trait-based interaction assembly on network structure. The SESNET of \\(R_{\\mathrm{Obs}},C_{\\mathrm{Null}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}\\) includes both the interaction assembly effect and the effect of consumer trait-based assembly. Consequently, \\(\\mathrm{SESNET}_{R_{\\mathrm{Obs}},C_{\\mathrm{Null}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}} - \\mathrm{SESNET}_{R_{\\mathrm{Obs}},C_{\\mathrm{Obs}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}}\\) constitutes the effect of trait-based consumer assembly on network structure. Similarly, \\(\\mathrm{SESNET}_{R_{\\mathrm{Null}},C_{\\mathrm{Obs}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}} - \\mathrm{SESNET}_{R_{\\mathrm{Obs}},C_{\\mathrm{Obs}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}}\\) constitutes the effect of trait-based resource assembly on network structure.\nconstitutes the effect of trait-based resource assembly on network structure. constitutes the effect of trait-based resource assembly on network structure. The SESNET of \\(R_{\\mathrm{Null}},C_{\\mathrm{Null}},I_{\\mathrm{Null}}\\) represents the total effect of all trait-based assembly processes on network structure, including their non-additive effects due to interactions among processes. The difference between this total effect and the sum of the interaction, consumer, and resource effects indicates the magnitude and direction of the non-additive effect.\nWe computed the network assembly mode for each of the networks sampled as the log-ratio of the SESNET of consumers (frugivores) and the SESNET of resources (plants). Similar to our simulation results. Positive values indicate predominant effects in network structure of the deterministic assembly of consumer communities whereas negative values indicate predominant effects in network structure of the deterministic assembly of resource communities.\n\n\nA.2.4 Sensitivity analyses\nFirstly, to account for the potential effects of particular species pool delineation when applying our null network model approach, we conducted a sensitivity analysis with distinct definitions of sampling probabilities of species from the regional pool to the local networks (Lessard et al. 2012). In addition to the process-based delineation described above, we simulated local communities by iteratively sampling one random species from any given site until the null community had the same species richness as the respective observed community.\nSecondly, we accounted for the potential effects of choosing particular metrics of trait distributions to calculate standardized effect sizes to test for environmental filtering. In addition to using standard deviation as a metric of trait distribution within plant and frugivore communities, we used trait range.\nAs a result, we applied the null model approach to two different species pool delineations and two different trait distribution metrics. In total, we generated four distinct scenarios to be compared: 1) process-based regional pool + standard deviations of trait distributions (results reported in the main text); 2) process-based regional pool + ranges of trait distributions; 3) randomized regional pool + standard deviations of trait distributions; 4) randomized regional pool + ranges of trait distributions.\nWe found that the delineation method of the species pool did not strongly affect the estimated community assembly process of either plants or frugivores along the elevational gradient. However, using trait range as a trait distribution metric resulted in community assembly processes that can be interpreted as stochastic community assembly at both trophic levels, whereas using standard deviation of the trait distribution as a trait distribution metric resulted in a tendency towards environmental filtering as the community assembly process for both trophic levels.\nWe found that the delineation method of the species pool caused variation in the process strength asymmetry direction and magnitude along the elevational gradient (Figure S3). However, independent of the regional pool delineation, the process strength asymmetry was consistentlypredominated by the plant community assembly process strength (Figure S3). The choice of trait distribution metric also caused variation in the process strength asymmetry direction and magnitude (Figure S3). In addition, the choice of trait distribution metric influenced the overall pattern of process strength asymmetry direction, indicating a more frugivore-inclined asymmetry (Figure S3). We conclude that the choice of methodology in defining the regional species pool and the trait distribution metric should be considered carefully to correspond to the ecological question and the focal study system.\n\n\n\nFigure S5. Process strength asymmetry variation along the elevational gradient. Plots illustrate three different process strength asymmetry distribution scenarios based on the regional pool delineations and trait distribution metrics. Panel A illustrates process-based regional pool + ranges of trait distributions (Proc + range). Panel B illustrates randomized regional pool + ranges of trait distributions (Random + range). Panel C illustrates randomized regional pool + standard deviations of trait distributions (Random + sd). Red symbols denote frugivores and blue symbols denote plants.\n\n\nTo test the robustness of the results with weighted network metrics and to illustrate the use of quantitative networks with our framework, we repeated the case study calculations using weighted interaction data (based on interaction frequencies) and weighted modularity as a metric of network structure (weighted Q; Beckett 2016). We calculated the weighted version of modularity Q relative to the ‘quasi_swap’ null rewire model (‘vegan’ package; Oksanen et al.2013). We did not find qualitative differences in the network assembly results between the analyses using binary and weighted versions of modularity (Table S1, Figure S4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable S3.

Network assembly along an elevational gradient. The figure shows the variation in network assembly mode (x-axis) along the elevational gradient (y-axis) when network structureis measured as weighted modularity (Q). Network assembly mode is quantified as the log-ratio between the absolute effect magnitudes of deterministic plant and frugivore assembly processes on network structure, quantified as modularity and nestedness. In bottom-up and top-down assembly modes, plant and frugivore community assembly effects are predominant, respectively. If the relative magnitudes of bottom-up and top-down assembly modes are equivalent, the network assembly mode = 0.\n\n\n\n\nA.2.5 Applying the null model approach to observational data: stepwise results\nIn step 1 of the null model approach, we quantified the type and strength of community and interaction assembly processes. Regarding community assembly, we found that plant and frugivore communities were functionally less dispersed than random expectations in one study site at lowest elevation, suggestive of environmental filtering (Figure 5 in the main text). At higher elevations, both plant and frugivore communities were more stochastically assembled, but the tendency was towards environmental filtering rather than limiting similarity. Regarding interaction assembly, we found signals of trait-based interaction assembly in the form of functional trait matching (Figure S2, Figure 4B in the main text).\nIn step 2 of the null model approach, we inferred the trait-based effects of community and interaction assembly on network structure. We did this by calculating the SESNET for each observed network against all four null networks in terms of modularity and nestedness (Table S2). Table S2. Standardized effect size (SESNET) summaries for each trait-based effect on the six plant-frugivore network structure along elevational gradient. The variables correspond to the null networks and the trait-based effects described and interpreted in Table 1 in the main text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable S4. Standardized effect sizes (SESNET) of assembly processes on network modularity and nestedness.\n\n\n\nThe table reports mean standardized effect sizes (SESNET) and 95% confidence intervals for modularity and nestedness under different null-model configurations and derived assembly components. Rows labeled R Obs/C Obs/I Null, R Null/C Obs/I Null, and R Obs/C Null/I Null correspond to null networks isolating interaction, consumer, and resource trait assembly effects, respectively, whereas R Null/C Null/I Null represents a fully randomized baseline. Derived rows summarize total trait effects, interaction assembly, plant assembly, frugivore assembly, and interaction among effects, calculated from contrasts among null models. Positive SESNET values indicate higher-than-expected structure relative to null expectations, while negative values indicate reduced structure. Confidence intervals are shown after standardizing lower and upper bounds for consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSESNET effects on modularity and nestedness\n\n\nMeans with 95% confidence intervals\n\n\nVariable\n\nModularity\n\n\nNestedness\n\n\n\nMean SESNET modularity\n95% CI (low)\n95% CI (high)\nMean SESNET nestedness\n95% CI (low)\n95% CI (high)\n\n\n\n\nR Obs C Obs I Null\n−2.66\n−4.09\n−1.22\n2.83\n−0.60\n6.27\n\n\nR Null C Obs I Null\n−2.79\n−4.40\n−1.17\n−0.99\n−2.17\n0.18\n\n\nR Obs C Null I Null\n−2.28\n−3.61\n−0.96\n3.66\n−0.35\n7.68\n\n\nR Null C Null I Null\n−0.82\n−1.10\n−0.55\n0.66\n−1.52\n0.19\n\n\nTotal trait effects\n14.43\n6.57\n22.30\n15.54\n7.68\n23.41\n\n\nInteraction assembly\n17.55\n9.38\n25.73\n8.69\n−1.67\n19.07\n\n\nPlant assembly\n−3.71\n−10.31\n2.88\n7.89\n0.92\n14.85\n\n\nFrugivore assembly\n0.79\n−7.38\n8.96\n0.05\n−4.15\n4.27\n\n\nInteraction among effects\n−7.62\n−15.13\n−0.12\n14.68\n3.48\n25.88\n\n\n\nCI bounds were standardized so the low column is the minimum and the high column is the maximum of the two reported 95% values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn step 3 of the null model approach, we interpreted the community and interaction assembly process effects on network structure by linking step 1 and step 2 (Figure S5). To visualize this, we scaled the additive partitioning to sum to 1 by normalizing the effect sizes of interaction assembly, consumer community assembly, and resource community assembly by the total deterministic effects. We recognize this spreads the synergistic effects among the three assembly components relative to the total deterministic effects. However, normalizing allows spreading the synergistic effects evenly for all assembly components. We interpreted that trait-based assembly effects increased both modularity and nestedness of plant-frugivore networks (‘Total trait effects’ in Table S2). Interaction assembly effects on modularity were largest in comparison to plant, frugivore, and non-additive assembly effects (Table S2). Interaction assembly effects on nestedness were also larger than the effects of plant and frugivore assembly, but smaller than the interactive effects (Table S2). Based on steps 1 and 2, we interpret that trait matching plays the most important role in shaping the frugivory network structure. There was a slight tendency toward environmental filtering in step 1 for both plant and frugivore trophic levels, indicating that environmental filtering plays a smaller, but somewhat significant direct role in shaping network structure. However, the filtering strength asymmetry had an indirect effect on the network structure.\n\n\n\nFigure S7. Ecological assembly processes shape the structure of empirical plant-frugivore networks along an elevational gradient. Triplot illustrates the relative influences of deterministic community and interaction assembly processes on network structure for six plantfrugivore networks along an elevational gradient in Ecuador. Symbol coordinates in the diagram space are drawn as a function of the relative contributions of each assembly process as percentage contributions to the total effect driving changes in network structure for each of the networks sampled. To identify the relative magnitude of a given process for a given network, start from the symbol position and follow each colored grid line until it meets its corresponding axis color. We plotted separately the relative contribution of assembly effects on modularity and nestedness (indicated with symbol color). Elevation of the observed network is indicated with the shape of the symbol.\n\n\n\n\nA.2.6 Future case studies\nThe generality of the results obtained with the case study on plant-frugivore interactions along an elevational gradient can be tested using other datasets and different study systems. We list some potential other big questions to be explored with the framework and the analytical steps outlined in our work (Table S3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable S5. Conceptual links between major questions in community ecology and a trait-based network assembly framework\n\n\n\nThe table outlines broad, recurring questions in community ecology, the analytical steps required to address each question within a trait-based multitrophic network framework, and illustrative example research questions. Together, these examples demonstrate how decomposing networks into community and interaction assembly components enables comparative analyses across interaction types, environmental gradients, and temporal scales, and facilitates inference on network structure, stability, and specialization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig questions in community ecology\n\n\nHow to address them with a trait-based framework, with example study questions\n\n\nGeneral question\nAddressing the question\nExample question\n\n\n\n\nHow are multitrophic communities assembled?\n• Determine assembly processes of each bipartite component network • Compare assembly of all component networks\nWhat is the relative influence of community and interaction assembly processes on food web structure?\n\n\nAre antagonistic and mutualistic networks assembled differently?\n• Determine assembly processes for different networks • Compare network metrics of differently assembled networks\nWhich community and interaction assembly processes shape host–parasite and pollination network structure?\n\n\nWhich abiotic and biotic factors explain geographic variation in bottom-up and top-down effects?\n• Evaluate strength of trait-based community assembly • Quantify process strength asymmetry and assembly mode • Relate trophic level assembly imbalance to abiotic and biotic gradients\nHow does the relative influence of plant and hummingbird community assembly on network structure vary along environmental gradients?\n\n\nHow does network assembly vary in time?\n• Determine assembly processes for each time point • Compare effects of community and interaction assembly on network structure in each time point\nDoes the influence of community assembly on predator–prey network structure vary temporally?\n\n\nWhich combinations of assembly processes produce the most stable networks?\n• Compare network metric values between differently assembled networks to find those with highest values of stability-related metric\nHow does the intensity of environmental filtering of animals affect the stability of seed dispersal networks?\n\n\nHow does the degree of specialization influence assembly cascades?\n• Quantify network structure as degree of specialization • Determine assembly processes for different networks • Compare networks of different assembly modes and degrees of specialization\nDo highly specialized host–parasite networks undergo assembly cascade?\n\n\n\nData describing pairwise interactions, regional species pools, and response and matching traits for all species in the regional pool are required to address these questions.",

Each model was evaluated based on its ability to estimate interaction probabilities that best predict the observed binary interaction data.\nFor the trait, connectance, and matching-centrality models, parameters were estimated with the Nelder–Mead algorithm via repeated maximum-likelihood optimization, using multiple random starts and averaging predictions from the best-fitting runs to avoid local optima. The stochastic block model instead assigns species to discrete interaction groups, such that interaction probabilities depend only on group membership, and uses a degree-corrected bipartite SBM algorithm to iteratively improve group assignments based on likelihood gains. To stabilize inference, multiple SBM fits were performed and predictions were averaged across the best solutions, yielding robust estimates of group structure and block-level interaction probabilities.",

    "text": "B.1.1 Stochastic Block Model (SBM)\nThe SBM assumes that networks exhibit a modular pattern, where subsets of species interact predominantly within other groups of highly connected species (Terry and Lewis, 2020). Interaction probabilities depend only on the group membership of species, not on individual species identities. Species are initially assigned to groups at random, and the model iteratively improves these assignments by moving species between groups to maximize the likelihood of the observed interaction network. This optimization results in an incidence matrix, Z, representing species-level group associations, and a squared matrix, Θ, reflecting interaction probabilities within and between groups. The likelihood (L) of the SBM is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 1\n\n\n\n\\[P(a\\_{ij} \\&gt; 0) = \\omega\\_{G_i G_j}\\]\nwhere: (\\(a_{ij}\\)) denotes the interaction between species (\\(i\\)) and (\\(j\\)); (\\(G_i\\)) and (\\(G_j\\)) are the interaction guild assignments of species (\\(i\\)) and (\\(j\\)); and (\\(\\omega_{G_i G_j}\\)) is the estimated probability of interaction between species belonging to those two guilds.\n\n\n\n\nB.1.2 Connectance Model\nIn the connectance model species are characterized by continuous connectivity scores that represent their tendency to interact broadly or narrowly within the network. The model assumes a generalist–specialist hierarchy, where interactions of specialist species are probabilistic subsets of those of generalists, rather than arising from discrete groups. Species connectivity scores are optimized by maximizing the likelihood of reproducing the observed interaction matrix. The likelihood (L) of the connectance model is given by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 2\n\n\n\n\\[\\operatorname{logit}!\\left(P(a\\_{ij} \\&gt; 0 \\mid \\mathbf{O})\\right) =\nc_i + c_j + k_C\\]\nwhere: (\\(a_{ij}\\)) denotes the interaction between species (\\(i\\)) and (\\(j\\)); (\\(c_i\\)) and (\\(c_j\\)) are species-specific connectivity parameters; (\\(k_C\\)) is a global intercept controlling overall connectance; and (\\(\\mathbf{O}\\)) denotes the observed interaction network.\n\n\n\n\nB.1.3 Matching-Trait Model\nThe matching-trait model assumes that interactions (Pᵢⱼ) are governed by trait compatibility rather than by overall connectance or group membership. Each species is positioned along one or more latent trait axes, and interaction probabilities increase when consumer and resource trait values are closely aligned. Model parameters are optimized by maximizing the likelihood of the observed interaction matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 3\n\n\n\n\\[\\operatorname{logit}!\\left(P(a\\_{ij} \\&gt; 0 \\mid \\mathbf{O})\\right) =\n-\\lambda (m_i - m_j)\\^2 + k_M\\]\nwhere: (\\(a_{ij}\\)) denotes the interaction between species (\\(i\\)) and (\\(j\\)); (\\(m_i\\)) and (\\(m_j\\)) are latent trait values for species (\\(i\\)) and (\\(j\\)); (\\(\\lambda\\)) determines how rapidly interaction probability declines with trait mismatch; (\\(k_M\\)) is a global intercept; and (\\(\\mathbf{O}\\)) denotes the observed interaction network.\n\n\n\n\nB.1.4 Matching-Centrality Model\nThe matching-centrality model integrates approaches from both the connectance and matching-trait models. It simultaneously optimizes species connectivity scores and trait axes to predict interactions. The likelihood (L) for this model is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 4\n\n\n\n\\[\\operatorname{logit}!\\left(P(a\\_{ij} \\&gt; 0 \\mid \\mathbf{O})\\right) =\nc_i + c_j - \\lambda (m_i - m_j)\\^2 + k_B \\]\nwhere: (\\(a_{ij}\\)) denotes the interaction between species (\\(i\\)) and (\\(j\\)); (\\(m_i\\)) and (\\(m_j\\)) are latent trait positions of species (\\(i\\)) and (\\(j\\)); (\\(\\lambda\\)) controls the strength of trait matching; (\\(c_i\\)) and (\\(c_j\\)) represent species-level connectivity effects; (\\(k_B\\)) is a model intercept; and (\\(\\mathbf{O}\\)) denotes the observed interaction network.\n\n\n\n\nB.1.5 Testing the accuracy of interaction assembly models\nFollowing guidelines established by Poisot (2023), we evaluated the accuracy of interaction assembly models using Youden’s J statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 5\n\n\n\n\\[J = \\text{sensitivity} + \\text{specificity} - 1\\]\n\n\nThis metric quantifies a model’s ability to correctly distinguish observed interactions from non-interactions by balancing sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate), and is independent of interaction prevalence. For each model, predicted interaction probabilities were converted to binary predictions using the threshold that maximized Youden’s J, allowing direct comparison of classification performance across alternative assembly hypotheses.In this context, higher values of Youden’s J indicate greater support for a given assembly model in reproducing observed interaction structure beyond random expectation.",

For example, resource availability is reflected in palm fruit size, stem height, and growth form, which determine which consumers can access and exploit resources. Consumer foraging strategies are captured by mammal diet composition, activity patterns, and body mass, distinguishing guilds dominated by nocturnal generalist frugivores from those structured around smaller, diurnal or crepuscular specialists.\n\n\n\nFigure B4. Functional differentiation of palms across interaction guilds. Boxplots show variation in average fruit length and maximum stem height (log-scaled) among interaction guilds, while the heatmap indicates the proportional representation of erect and acaulescent growth forms. Together, these patterns reveal distinct palm trait syndromes associated with different interaction guilds.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure B5. Functional differentiation of mammals across interaction guilds. Heatmaps show the proportional composition of mammal diet traits and activity patterns across interaction guilds, while boxplots depict variation in mammalian body mass (log-scaled).

We use these traits to train multinomial models that predict interaction guilds for all other palm and mammal species in the neotropics without interaction data but information on their traits.\nWe use multinomial logistic regression models to predict interaction guilds with species trait data. We justify the choice of multinomial logistic regression models as these can handle the prediction of non-binary outcomes, that is in our case, the labeling of SBM groupings per species. We extracted variable importance scores with combinations of the absolute values of the model weights (Gevrey, Dimopoulos, and Lek 2003).\n\n\n\nFigure B6: Trait-based characterization of mammal–palm interaction guilds.

Variable importance from neural network models fitted with caret. Bar plots show relative variable importance for the palm model (left) and the mammal model (right), calculated using caret::varImp applied to refitted neural network classifiers. For neural networks, variable importance follows the method of Gevrey et al. (2003), in which importance is derived from combinations of the absolute values of connection weights linking each input variable to the hidden and output layers. For classification models, class specific importances are identical and are therefore shown as a single score per variable. Importance values are scaled relative to the most influential predictor within each model, enabling comparison across traits. Results indicate that plant growth form strongly dominates the palm model, whereas mammal activity patterns are the primary drivers of the mammal model, with secondary contributions from diet and body mass.\n\n\n\n\n\nB.2.4 Building spatially explicit synthetic networks\n\nB.2.4.1 Finding co-occuring assemblages at the grid-cell level\nTo identify local co-occurring assemblages of palms and mammals, we converted species range polygons into presence-by-grid-cell representations using a common spatial grid across the Neotropics. When creating grids, we do not consider spherical geometries to avoid topology artifacts (e.g., duplicate vertices) that can occur when intersecting complex polygons as the spatial representations of species ranges. We then created a 1° × 1° grid covering the Neotropics and intersected the grid with each palm and mammal ranges to create local species occurrences. These gridded palm and mammal presence layers can then be combined per grid cell to define local palm assemblages, local mammal assemblages, and ultimately co-occurring palm–mammal assemblages used in downstream network construction and trait-based analyses.\n\n\n\nFigure B8. Spatial grid used to define local assemblages across the Neotropics. Map shows the 1° × 1° spatial grid overlaid on the Neotropical region.

We applied an exclusion criteria to the list of grids before applying this network generating algorithm, and selected only those grids with at least 5 palm and 5 mammal species.",

    "text": "B.3 Evaluating functional changes in networks across environmental gradients\n\nB.3.1 Bioclimatic data\nWorldClim bioclimatic variables are derived from long-term monthly climate surfaces based on weather station records distributed globally. WorldClim variables are generated by spatially interpolating station data using thin-plate splines that incorporate elevation and other covariates, producing continuous gridded climate surfaces that represent regional climatic gradients across complex tropical topography. We used the following as spatial predictors:\n\nMean Annual Temperature (BIO01) represents the average temperature over all months of the year and summarizes the overall thermal energy available to ecosystems.\nTotal Annual Precipitation (BIO12) is the sum of monthly precipitation values and captures the total annual water input to a region.\nTemperature Seasonality (BIO14) quantifies the amount of temperature variation over the year, calculated as the standard deviation of monthly mean temperatures multiplied by 100, and reflects the degree of thermal variability.\nPrecipitation Seasonality (BIO15) measures the variability of monthly precipitation totals, expressed as the coefficient of variation, and indicates how evenly precipitation is distributed throughout the year.\n\n\n\n\nFigure B9. Climatic context of the Neotropics used in network analyses. Spatial distributions of mean annual temperature, total annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality, and temperature seasonality across the Neotropics. Maps summarize the broad climatic gradients that structure species distributions and interaction assemblages, and serve as environmental predictors for assessing how climate modulates functional richness and interaction guild organization.\n\n\n\n\nB.3.2 Measuring interaction guild diversity across the environmental gradient\nWe performed spatial joins to associate each grid-cell species assemblage with corresponding bioclimatic variables. We then quantified variation in the relative occupancy of interaction guilds inferred by the stochastic block model by calculating, for each grid cell, the proportion of palm or mammal species assigned to each interaction guild. For a given assemblage, we first counted the number of palm species and mammal species assigned to each interaction guild. These counts were then normalized by the total number of species in each trophic level to obtain proportional guild representations.\nUnlike trait-space–based measures of functional richness that quantify the volume of multivariate trait space occupied by species, our network-based formulation captures diversity in realized interaction roles rather than diversity in trait values per se. Because interactions in bipartite networks reflect both trait matching and network structure, functional richness defined from SBM-derived interaction guilds captures realized ecological roles rather than only trait diversity.\n\n\n\nFigure B10: Changes in the functional richness of mammals along climatic gradients across interaction guilds. Each row represents a distinct mammal–palm interaction guild (IG-1 to IG-7), identified through stochastic block modeling, while each column corresponds to an environmental gradient: mean annual temperature (MAT, in °C), total annual precipitation (TAP, in mm), temperature seasonality (TS, expressed as the standard deviation of monthly temperature ×100), and precipitation seasonality (PS, represented as the coefficient of variation). In each panel, the y-axis shows the functional richness of mammal communities, and the x-axis shows the corresponding environmental gradient. Red smoothed lines represent observed trends in mammal functional richness, while green smoothed lines represent trends for the associated palm communities within the same guild. Shaded ribbons around the smoothed lines indicate 95% confidence intervals. Background colors delineate different interaction guilds to aid visual interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable B2: Model estimates between FR and climate.\n\n\n\nParametric terms from separate GAMs predicting functional richness (FR) in palms (“FR Palms”) and mammal frugivores (“FR Mammals”).

This resulted on 49 individual metrics (7 x 7 ) of FTA per gridcell, each representing a unique interaction guild combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 7\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathrm{FTA}_{g_ig_j} = \\left|Fr^{P}_{g_i} - Fr^{M}_{g_j}\\right|\\]\nwhere: (\\(\\mathrm{FTA}_{g_i g_j}\\)) is the functional trophic asymmetry between palms and mammals for interaction guilds combinations between palms (\\(g_i\\)) and mammals (\\(g_j\\)); (\\(Fr^{P}_{g_i}\\)) is the relative proportion of palm species assigned to guild (\\(g_i\\)); and (\\(Fr^{M}_{g_j}\\)) is the relative proportion of mammal species assigned to guild (\\(g_j\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure S4: Ridgeline densities of Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) for each realized mammal–palm “interaction guild” (mXpY) across Neotropical grid cells. Each label on the y-axis—e.g. m3p2—denotes the pairing of mammal guild 3 (small-bodied, low-frugivory, predominantly nocturnal species: mean mass ≈ 4.75 kg; 21.7 % fruit diet; 84 % nocturnal) with palm guild 2 (tall, small-fruited, erect palms: 25 species; mean height ≈ 3.05 m; fruit length ≈ 0.8 cm; 100 % erect). The x-axis shows FTA values (0 = symmetrical trait distributions, 1 = maximal mismatch), and each ridge plots the distribution of FTA across all grid cells where that guild pair co-occurs. Guilds combining large, low-frugivory mammals (e.g. m6) with short, large-fruited palms (p6) (see table 3 for trait distribution reference) exhibit the highest asymmetry (densities shifted right), whereas guilds of small, highly frugivorous mammals paired with tall, small-fruited palms (e.g. m1p2) cluster near zero.\n\n\nWe summed FTA values across all interaction guild combinations to obtain an aggregate metric of FTA per grid cell \\(FTA_{sum}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 8\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathrm{FTA}_{\\mathrm{sum}} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G}  \\mathrm{FTA_g} \\]\nwhere: (\\(\\mathrm{FTA}_{sum}\\)) is the aggregate functional trophic asymmetry across all interaction guilds; (\\(G\\)) is the total number of palm-mammal interaction guilds combinations inferred by the stochastic block model (49); (\\(\\mathrm{FTA}\\)) is the functional trophic asymmetry between palms and mammals guilds.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Distribution of summed Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA(_{\\mathrm{sum}})) across Neotropical grid cells.** The histogram shows the frequency distribution of (\\mathrm{FTA}_{\\mathrm{sum}}), which aggregates absolute trait asymmetries across all interacting mammal–palm guild pairs within each grid cell. Higher values indicate greater overall mismatch in functional traits between consumer and resource assemblages, whereas lower values reflect more symmetric guild composition.\n\n\nBecause \\(FTA_{sum}\\) can be sensitive to asymmetries arising in weakly connected parts of the network, weighting functional trophic asymmetry by inter-guild interaction strength accounts for the fact that not all guild mismatches are equally relevant to network organization. The adjusted metric therefore prioritizes asymmetry in strongly interacting guild pairs, providing a more ecologically meaningful measure of trophic imbalance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquation 9\n\n\n\n\\[\\mathrm{FTA}_{sum_{adj}} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} FTA \\times I_{g_ig_j}\\]\nwhere: (\\(I_{g_i g_j}\\)) is the strenght of interaction between palm-mammal guilds.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Distribution of adjusted summed Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA(_{\\mathrm{sum,adj}})) across Neotropical grid cells.** The histogram depicts the frequency distribution of the interaction-weighted FTA metric, in which trait asymmetries among mammal–palm guild pairs are scaled by the strength of their inferred interactions. This adjustment down-weights rare or weakly connected guild combinations, emphasizing asymmetry arising from ecologically dominant interactions and providing a more conservative measure of functional mismatch at the assemblage level.\n\n\n\nB.3.3.1 Evaluating the relationship between FTA and interaction strength\nTo ensure that the interaction‐weighted adjustment did not introduce systematic bias, we explicitly tested whether the \\(FTA_{sum_{adj}}\\)was correlated with interaction strength. This assessment verifies that the adjustment does not trivially inflate or deflate asymmetry values as a direct function of interaction intensity, but instead preserves FTA as an independent measure of trait mismatch.\n\n\n\nFigure S7: Relationship between interaction strength and Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) for 43/49 grid‐cell–interaction guild observations. Points show the median FTA values plotted against interaction strength, with the blue line and grey band representing the fitted linear regression (±95 % CI). The model intercept significantly different from 0, 0.19 (95 % CI 0.12–0.25, p &lt; 0.001), but the slope for interaction strength is small and non‐significant (β = 0.18, 95 % CI –0.27 to 0.62, p = 0.426).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n####Table B3: Simple linear regression of adjusted Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) on interaction strength.\nThe intercept of 0.19 (95 % CI: 0.12–0.25, p &lt; 0.001) represents the baseline FTA when interaction strength is zero, while the slope coefficient for interaction strength is 0.18 (95 % CI: –0.27–0.62, p = 0.426), indicating that variation in interaction strength does not significantly predict changes in FTA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Results\n\n\nCoefficient estimates with 95% confidence intervals\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.19\n0.12 – 0.25\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nInteraction strength\n0.18\n-0.27 – 0.62\n0.426\n\n\n\nObservations = 43 | R² / R² adjusted = 0.016 / -0.008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB.3.4 Does climate determine FTA?\nWe used generalized additive models (mgcv) to relate the response to climatic predictors—mean annual temperature (Temp), precipitation seasonality (PS), temperature seasonality (TS), and total annual precipitation (Prec)—and to interaction strength (int_str). Each climate variable was included as a univariate smooth s(⋅) (thin-plate regression spline; k=9k=9k=9), and potential modulation by interaction strength was modeled using smooth interaction terms s(climate,int_str)(k=27). A separate smooth s(int_str) captured nonlinear effects of interaction strength. Smoothing parameters were selected by generalized cross-validation (GCV) using the magic optimizer. Model adequacy was evaluated using mgcv basis-dimension checks (k-index), effective degrees of freedom, and residual diagnostics.\nChecks on the basis dimensions show no evidence that any smooth term is underfit: the climatic predictors (temperature, precipitation, and their seasonalities) have effective degrees of freedom close to one and k-indices near one with high p-values, indicating that their effects are approximately linear and adequately captured by the chosen smooths. Interaction terms between climate variables and interaction strength show very low complexity. In contrast, the smooth term for interaction strength alone is highly flexible and strongly supported, indicating a pronounced nonlinear relationship. Convergence diagnostics indicate a stable and well-conditioned model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable B4.

Estimated smooth relationships from a GAM of Functional Trophic Asymmetry (FTA) against four climatic variables and interaction strength. Across all panels, mean annual temperature (Temp) shows a gentle, positive association with FTA, while total precipitation and temperature seasonality exert negligible or slightly negative effects. Precipitation (Prec) seasonality likewise produces only a weak upward trend at high values. Importantly, none of the tensor‐product interaction terms between interaction strength and any climate variable deviate meaningfully from zero, indicating that interaction strength (int_str) does not modify how climate influences trait asymmetry. The standalone smooth for interaction strength itself exhibits undulating but statistically uncertain variation, suggesting no clear direct effect. Shaded bands around each curve denote approximately 95 % confidence intervals, and tick marks along the axes mark the range of observed data.\n\n\n\n\nB.3.5 Does FTA influence network structure?\nWe examine the variation in network structure with network specialization and the spectral radius. We computed a metric of network-level specialization (H2’) that is independent of network size and marginal totals. The metric is computed from the interaction matrix by comparing the deviation of interaction frequencies from a null expectation based on species’ total interaction frequencies, and is then normalized to range between 0 (no specialization, complete generalization) and 1 (maximum specialization). In addition, we used the spectral radius as a complementary metric of network structure. The spectral radius is computed as the largest eigenvalue of the (weighted or binary) interaction matrix. This metric captures the dominant mode of interaction structure in the network, reflecting how strongly interactions are concentrated along a few highly connected species or pathways. A larger spectral radius indicates a more centralized interaction structure dominated by generalists, whereas lower values suggest interactions that are more evenly distributed creating diffuse networks.\n\n\n\nFigure X. Relationship between network specialization and structural concentration. Scatterplot showing grid-cell values of network specialization (H2′) plotted against the log-transformed spectral radius of the interaction matrix.\n\n\nWe control for differences in sampling intensity and network size by standardizing interaction data to a common level of observation. Specifically, we used rarefy function from cassandRa to repeatedly subsample interactions from the original bipartite gridcell level network to a fixed number (100) of interactions and recalculates network structural metrics (i.e network specialization, structural radius) on each subsample. We used the median of this subsampled distribution as the gridcell metric of network structure. This procedure reduces biases that arise because larger or more densely sampled assemblages tend to exhibit higher connectance.\n\n\nB.3.5.1 Evaluating the relationship between FTA and H2’\n\n\n\nFigure S9.Functional trophic asymmetry predicts network specialization.

    "text": "C.1.0.1 Assigning fossil locations to a period in the Neogene\nFossil occurrences were assigned to discrete Neogene stages based on the midpoint of their reported geological age ranges (Ma). Midpoint ages were intersected with the standard Neogene chronostratigraphic framework (Aquitanian–Piacenzian). Midpoint ages within a single stage were assigned directly to that stage. This discretization facilitates stage-level comparisons while acknowledging that fossil ages are inherently uncertain.\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Temporal distribution of Neogene fossil assemblages.** Points show individual fossil assemblage ages (Ma) plotted by Neogene stage, arranged using stage midpoints on the y-axis. Blue points represent assemblage mid-age estimates, while red ticks indicate the full temporal range of age uncertainty for each assemblage. Horizontal black lines summarize the overall age span represented within each stage. The figure illustrates both the concentration of fossil data through time and the variation in temporal uncertainty across Neogene intervals.\n\n\n\n\nC.1.0.2 Evaluating sampling effort\nSampling effort was evaluated as the relationship between the number of sampled fossil localities and observed generic richness for every stage in the Neogene. Sampling–richness relationships were examined within each Neogene stage to assess how efficiently additional localities contributed to the recovery of new genera and to identify stages showing evidence of saturation versus continued sampling dependence.\n\n\n\n**Figure X.

Rarefied family-level richness across Neogene stages.** Bars show mean rarefied richness of families for each Neogene stage, with error bars indicating uncertainty around the estimates (e.g., ±1 SE). Rarefaction accounts for differences in sampling intensity among stages, allowing direct comparison of family-level diversity through the Neogene. The results indicate higher standardized richness during the early to middle Neogene and a decline toward the late Neogene.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Temporal variation in generic richness through the Neogene.** The line shows changes in observed genus-level richness plotted against geological age (Ma) across the Neogene. The stratigraphic bar below the plot delineates individual Neogene stages and their grouping within the Neogene period, providing temporal context for richness fluctuations. The figure illustrates pronounced stage-to-stage variability in generic diversity superimposed on broader Neogene-scale trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Rarefied genus-level richness across Neogene stages.** Bars show mean rarefied generic richness for each Neogene stage, with error bars indicating uncertainty around the estimates (e.g., ±1 SE).

Paleorotation was performed independently for each fossil occurrence using its stage-level age assignment, ensuring temporal consistency between spatial location and geological period. The rotation model (MERDITH2021) accounts for large-scale plate motions through time and produces paleolongitude and paleolatitude estimates that are directly comparable across Neogene stages.\n\n\n\nFigure S1: Spatial distribution of mammalian fossil localities across eight Neogene time intervals (Aquitanian–Piacenzian) in Europe and North America. Each panel represents the geographic occurrence of fossil assemblages within a 1° grid. Present-day (black) and rotated (red) paleoocordinates are shown.\n\n\n\n\nC.1.1.2 Grid aggregation of fossil data\nPaleorotated coordinates were subsequently used to assign fossil occurrences to a discrete grid cells of approximately 100 × 100 km in paleogeographic space. Grid aggregation reduces the influence of uneven spatial sampling density and local clustering of fossil localities, while retaining sufficient spatial resolution to capture broad-scale paleobiogeographic structure. Fossil occurrences falling within the same grid cell and Neogene stage were grouped into a single paleoassemblage, which served as the fundamental unit for subsequent diversity, compositional, and network analyses.\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Geographic distribution of fossil assemblage centroids.** Points represent the longitude–latitude coordinates of paleoassemblage grid-cell centroids included in the analysis. Assemblages are concentrated in two main regions corresponding broadly to North America (western cluster) and Europe–western Eurasia (eastern cluster), reflecting the spatial coverage of the fossil record used in this study.

    "text": "C.2 Paleoclimatic data\n\nC.2.1 Temporal binning of climatic rasters (1 Ma) within Neogene stages\nPaleoclimate reconstructions were organized into discrete, stage-specific climate stacks by binning rasters at 1 Ma resolution within each Neogene stage (Aquitanian–Piacenzian). For each stage, we identified all paleoatmospheric temperature rasters whose time stamps fell within that stage’s chronostratigraphic boundaries and grouped them into a single multi-layer object (e.g., “Temp.1”, “Temp.2”, … in Fig. S3). This procedure preserves within-stage temporal information while ensuring that all climatic summaries are computed from time slices that are chronologically consistent with the fossil data assigned to that stage. Because stages differ in duration, the number of 1 Ma rasters per stage varies, reflecting the amount of temporal coverage available within each interval.\n\n\n\n**Figure S3. Paleotemperature reconstructions for the Neogene.** Spatial reconstructions of paleoatmospheric temperature for eight Neogene stages (Aquitanian–Piacenzian), shown separately for North America and Europe. For each stage, multiple temperature layers (“Temp” fields) represent alternative reconstructions or time slices within the stage, capturing spatial heterogeneity and within-stage climatic variability. Color scales denote reconstructed temperature (°C), illustrating the persistence and evolution of large-scale temperature gradients through the Neogene.\n\n\nThese stage-specific raster stacks were subsequently used to derive three complementary climatic descriptors for each grid cell: (i) the mean temperature across all 1 Ma slices within the stage (capturing average climatic conditions), (ii) the temporal slope of temperature through the stage (capturing directional change), and (iii) temporal instability, quantified as within-stage variability among 1 Ma slices (capturing fluctuations around the mean). These variables capture average conditions, directional climatic change, and within-stage variability, respectively, and together describe the climatic context experienced by fossil assemblages. Together, this temporal binning strategy allows climate to be summarized in a way that matches the temporal granularity of Neogene stages while retaining meaningful information on both climatic trends and variability within each stage.\n\nC.2.1.1 Mean atmospheric temperature\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Mean atmospheric temperature across Neogene stages.** Panels show the mean reconstructed atmospheric temperature for each Neogene stage (Aquitanian–Piacenzian), obtained by averaging paleoatmospheric temperature layers within each stage. Maps are shown for North America and Europe, with colors indicating temperature in °C. The figure summarizes broad-scale spatial temperature gradients and their temporal evolution through the Neogene, providing a baseline climatic context for subsequent analyses.\n\n\n\n\nC.2.1.2 Temporal slope of atmospheric temperature (Magnitude & Direction Climate Change)\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Mean atmospheric temperature across Neogene stages.** Panels show the mean reconstructed atmospheric temperature for each Neogene stage (Aquitanian–Piacenzian), obtained by averaging paleoatmospheric temperature layers within each stage. Maps are shown for North America and Europe, with colors indicating temperature in °C. The figure summarizes broad-scale spatial temperature gradients and their temporal evolution through the Neogene, providing a baseline climatic context for subsequent analyses.\n\n\n\n\nC.2.1.3 Temporal instability of atmospheric temperature\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Temporal instability of atmospheric temperature across Neogene stages.** Panels depict the temporal instability of reconstructed atmospheric temperature for each Neogene stage (Aquitanian–Piacenzian), quantified as the within-stage variability among paleoatmospheric temperature layers. Higher values (warm colors) indicate greater temporal variability, whereas lower values (cool colors) reflect more stable climatic conditions. The figure illustrates spatial heterogeneity in climatic stability through the Neogene and provides a complementary metric to mean temperature and temporal slope patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\nC.2.2 Delineating paleoclimatic zones\nPaleoclimatic zones were delineated to identify spatially and temporally coherent units of climatic conditions across the Neogene. For each grid cell and Neogene stage, we summarized paleoclimate using three complementary descriptors derived from the 1 Ma–binned mean atmospheric temperature rasters. To reduce dimensionality and account for covariance among climatic descriptors, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the standardized climate variables across all grid cells and stages. The leading principal components, which captured the majority of climatic variation, were retained and used as inputs for clustering.\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Variance explained by principal components of paleoclimatic variables.** Bar plot showing the variance explained by each principal component derived from the paleoclimatic dataset. The first component accounts for the majority of the total variance, whereas subsequent components explain progressively smaller proportions, indicating that most large-scale climatic variation through the Neogene is captured along a dominant primary gradient.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Spatial patterns of principal components of temporal temperature instability.** Maps show the spatial loadings of the first eight principal components (PC1–PC8) derived from the temporal instability of atmospheric temperature across the Neogene. PC1 captures the dominant large-scale gradient in climatic instability, whereas higher-order components explain progressively finer-scale or weaker spatial structure. Color scales indicate the magnitude and direction of component loadings, illustrating how major modes of climatic instability are distributed across North America and Europe.\n\n\nPaleoclimatic zones were then defined using k-means clustering in this reduced climatic space, grouping grid cells with similar climatic histories across space and time. The optimal number of clusters was selected based on the Calinski–Harabasz criterion, balancing within-cluster homogeneity and between-cluster separation.\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Comparison of K-means clustering solutions and selection of the optimal number of clusters.** The left panel shows K-means partitions of objects for solutions with increasing numbers of clusters (k), illustrating how group membership changes as k increases. The right panel reports the Calinski–Harabasz criterion for each k, with the highlighted point indicating the optimal clustering solution based on the maximum criterion value. Together, these panels justify the choice of k used in subsequent analyses.\n\n\nResulting clusters represent climatic spatiotemporal zones that integrate both geographic structure and temporal climatic dynamics. Each grid cell–stage combination was assigned to a climatic spatiotemporal zone. This grouping captures shared climatic histories and provides a way to account for spatial autocorrelation, given that nearby grid cells tend to exhibit similar climatic trajectories through time.\n\n\n\n**Figure X. Climatic spatiotemporal zones derived from multivariate clustering.** Hexagonal grid cells across North America and Europe are classified into five climatic spatiotemporal zones based on multivariate climate characteristics through the Neogene. Colors denote cluster membership (zones 1–5), capturing coherent regions that integrate both spatial structure and temporal climatic dynamics. Unfilled hexagons indicate areas without sufficient data coverage. The map illustrates broad-scale climatic regionalization used to define comparative units in subsequent analyses.",

For each pair of paleoassemblages, we calculated taxonomic dissimilarity using presence–absence data at the genus level. Assemblages were defined as unique combinations of spatial grid cells and Neogene stages, ensuring that dissimilarity comparisons reflected both spatial and temporal separation.\nWe used the Simpson dissimilarity index (β_SIM) to quantify compositional turnover between assemblages. β_SIM emphasizes taxon replacement while minimizing the influence of differences in richness, making it well suited for fossil data where sampling intensity varies among assemblages.\n\n\n\n**Figure X.
