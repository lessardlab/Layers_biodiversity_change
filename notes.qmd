H2 specialization, characterizes the specialization of the entire network by quantifying the extent that interaction frequencies deviate from expected frequencies given the species' total frequencies.

At the network level, large values of *H*2′ indicate high specialization (range: 0–1),

For both types of networks, we measured the variation in network structure between islands using the binary Sørensen dissimilarity index \[[**58**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2023.1372#RSPB20231372C58)\], in which interaction dissimilarity is calculated between two networks *M* and *N* as *β*WN = (*b* + *c*)/(2*a* + *b* + *c*), wherein *a* is the number of interactions occurring in both networks, *b* is the number of interactions occurring only in the network *M*, and *c* is the number of interactions occurring only in the network *N*. Furthermore, we partitioned *β*WN into interaction dissimilarity due to species turnover (*β*ST) and interaction rewiring (*β*OS; i.e. flexibility of interactions among shared species) \[[**35**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2023.1372#RSPB20231372C35)\], following the partitioning approach of Novotny \[[**59**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2023.1372#RSPB20231372C59)\]. Partitioning total beta diversity allows us to evaluate whether the variations in network structure among islands are either mostly affected by differences in species turnover (*β*ST) or by interaction rewiring (*β*OS) \[[**47**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2023.1372#RSPB20231372C47)\].

We calculated interaction dissimilarity among networks with the *betalinkr_multi* function by setting the parameter ‘index’ as ‘sorensen’ and ‘partitioning’ as ‘commondenom’ in the R package ‘bipartite’, v. 2.18 \[[**35**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2023.1372#RSPB20231372C35),[**60**](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2023.1372#RSPB20231372C60)\]. We compared interaction dissimilarity of species turnover (*β*ST) and interaction rewiring (*β*OS) in this study using the two-tailed *t*-test.
